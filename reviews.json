These are just as absorbent as the Honest brand and have the same quality, no toxic chemicals, no fragrance. It is perfect. They have cute designs just like Honest does too and for a much better price! I\u2019m happy I tried these for my baby.\n\nI see people in the reviews complain about them not being as absorbent as they would like but personally, I would never keep my baby in even a wet diaper knowing he\u2019s uncomfortable. I have an 11 week old baby that sleeps through the night and he doesn\u2019t wake up in discomfort not once for diaper change but he also rarely soils the diaper at night.\n\nHope this helps other parents!"

The adorable wild cats print is such a fun touch that makes diaper changes more cheerful.\n\n**Absorbency:** These diapers are highly absorbent and can last through long naps and even overnight without leaks. They do an excellent job of keeping my little one dry and comfortable.\n\n**Fit:** The size 3 diapers fit my baby (17 lbs) perfectly, with a snug yet gentle fit around the waist and legs. The stretchy tabs make it easy to get a secure fit, which prevents leaks while allowing my baby to move freely.\n\n**Softness:** The material is super soft, which is important for sensitive baby skin. We haven\u2019t had any issues with diaper rashes or irritation since switching to Hello Bello.\n\n**Eco-Conscious:** I also love that Hello Bello prioritizes being eco-friendly while maintaining affordability. It\u2019s nice knowing these diapers are made with plant-based ingredients without sacrificing quality.\n\n**Value:** The 100-count value pack is such a great deal. It\u2019s convenient not having to buy diapers as often, and I appreciate the quality at this price point.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend **Hello Bello Diapers** for any parent looking for a high-quality, stylish, and reliable diaper option. It\u2019s a win-win for both baby and parent!"

We don't get excited about any design on them, since they are just disposable diapers and are often under clothing, but the design is cute.\n\nThe closure holds tight and have not let go even once. No issue with chaffing or binding around the legs. We like them and will consider them when we have to buy more."

She is big for her age (about 43 inches, 43 pounds) so we are starting to have a hard time finding something that fits well and is absorbent enough to last all night, but these really fit the bill. They are very soft inside - actually softer than the cloth diapers we used when our kids were babies, almost like a tissue, but have been absorbent so far. It's not a big deal in our case but I was surprised that they don't have a wetness indicator, which might be a game changer for an infant or younger kid."

Of course the cute designs are a fun feature but more importantly these diapers are good where it really matters - comfort and absorbency!\n\nThese diapers are soft to the touch, structured perfectly to fit well and prevent leaks, and of course have a lot of power when it comes to absorbing pee! Overall these diapers have been great for us from infancy into the crawling stage where diapers really get put to the test with a wiggly and always moving baby!"

Super cute! I haven't had any problems with leaks (even after long days away from home with my baby when it's hard to get regular diaper changes done). Sometimes other brands I use have scratchy spots on the waistband that irritate my baby's skin, but I haven't noticed problems with these. The tabs for securing the diaper haven't torn or come off which is also nice to not have to deal with in the middle of a frantic, wiggly diaper change battle! I'd say these are definitely some of the better diapers I've used."

We actually tried a more expensive, supposedly organic brand real cotton brand that caused a rash on the baby. we didn't think it could be them until after 2 dr visits and the only thing left was the diapers.\n\nThe Hello Bello (and Honest) brand is wonderful! Once you try them and your baby does well with them, it's not worth chancing a rash or an allergy to save a few pennies, or to even spend more. When you find something that works, stick with it!

It is definalty adequate for most littles with no leaks, it is best for pre potty trained as the tabs still give the diaper feel, price is ok for a natural diaper but there are cheaper options our there, quality is great, pattern is cute, since it's natural materials it's good for senstive skin, diaper is of similar thickness to huggies natural care so it shouldn't be bothersome, no leaks so far, stretchy enough to handle movement of.toddler."

The soft padded material is gentle on the skin and seems to be reasonably absorbent. The elastic around the legs has a good amount of stretchiness to it, and it seems to provide for a decent fit that would help prevent leaks. The printed Wild Cats design is fun, and it\u2019s a nice change from the plain white diapers we normally see.\n\nI am keeping a few of these on hand for when my nieces and nephews visit. The rest are going in a gift basket I\u2019m putting together for my sister who had a little girl a couple months ago. It may be a while before she can use these, but babies grow so quickly, and having a good range of diaper sizes available will be very helpful for her. I\u2019m happy with the apparent quality of these diapers, to the extent that I\u2019ve been able to test their absorbency, the adhesive tabs, and feel how soft they are. I think these are a pretty reasonable value for a pack of 100."

I appreciate their customer service and willingness to make it right, I guess you could say. 5 stars for customer service. I Iike how soft these are and the material they are made of but for some dumb reason there is a channel all throughout the diapers where the material is that would otherwise soak up pee. Why would you skimp on the absorbant part of a diaper?\n\nWe realized this when our baby had diarrhea and it kept leaking out the sides of the diaper. Also the tabs to close the diaper are kind of narrow and small so the front of the diaper gets kinda wonky if your baby likes to move around. If these two things weren't an issue I'd give 5 stars and purchase again. But for now we will go back to huggies."

It is very thin. You can see through it. I tried this and these were blow out central. Possibly because they run smaller than average size 5. My baby is not chunky. He\u2019s average size for his age and these were small. If you get them definitely size up especially if you have a chunky kiddo. They were fine for pee but you\u2019ll definitely change them a lot as they are quite thin. They didnt seem to keep him as dry as I prefer. Overall I did not really like anything about them. I was trying to find something cheaper but good enough these won\u2019t work. Honest diapers are better than these and those to me aren\u2019t good. I tried to be as thorough as possible because these are things I was looking for in reviews. I hope this business can take this review into account and make the diapers better."

We've been using them for a month now and we've had NO issues so far. While they do seem thinner than other diapers, but there have been no leaks or blowouts. The price right now is amazing. They're also made with a cute simple print print design as well. Will definitely keep buying!"

You know how some other diapers have a line that changes color to indicate wetness. This does not have that at all. These feel like a cheap plant material used. I\u2019m all for helping the environment but not if I have to use 10x more diapers\u2026\n2) it just doesn\u2019t feel like an absorbent product. Her skin always feels wet.\n3) not the best for overnight. She now sleeps through the night so I don\u2019t get up as often but when I do it\u2019s because she\u2019s peed through the diaper because it\u2019s not that absorbent. Gotta constantly change them anyway.\nI gave 2 stars because I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cmean\u201d\u2026 but yeah we aren\u2019t buying these again. They are \ud83d\udca9 diapers."

We cloth diaper at home and use Lillydoo diapers when we are out and at night and we have had to size up after using 80-160 diapers (currently using size 4). Our little guy is on the large side for his age. Please consider that babies come in all shapes and sizes so what works for one baby may not work for others. I do recommend to try them as they are economical and a premium quality."

I tried so many brands and this one was the only one not giving her rashes, but also keeping her dry during day and night! We rarely had any blowouts.\nNow, with my youngest, I was looking for something TCF, but also absorbent and affordable. I like a couple of different brands, but haven\u2019t been able to find anything TCF that would last over 12h during the night. So when these diapers became available in the US, I got excited.\nAfter almost 7 years I only remembered really loving them.\nHere\u2019re my thoughts after trying them again:\nMy initial thought was that I don\u2019t remember them being so thin! I also thought they used to be softer and felt less like plastic back then.\nBut after putting them on over night, I love them just like I used to. They are very absorbent and pull the wetness away from the baby. They won\u2019t feel as thin once you change baby and I like how, especially during the night, baby doesn\u2019t have to wear a super thick diaper.\nGranted, they feel more like plastic than for example pu*a diapers (orange packaging), but they\u2019re OEKO Tex certified and TCF, so I\u2019m okay with it, especially since it\u2019s not like that inside. I\u2019ll be buying again and hope they\u2019ll soon have more cute designs available like they do in Germany!"

Even if I put my 18mo in a fresh diaper before her 2 hour nap, it never fails to leak.. forcing me to not only wash her off, but wash her bedding every. Single. Day.\n\nThey don\u2019t fit comfortably on my toddler, they may be soft but because they are so soft they don\u2019t stay on my toddler. I\u2019ve resorted to putting on her training underwear on on top of her diaper so I can prevent it from slipping and moving and leaking. They gave her a rash and the little beads leak if the diapers too full.. which doesn\u2019t take much considering the diapers leak after a 2 hour nap.\n\nWish I could get my money back."

We've been using the Eco Boom diapers for quite some time and made the switch to pull ups after we visited Japan and babies transition to pull up style much earlier, so we got used to them. Our son is 21 months and wearing size L.\n\nWe currently have inventory of Eco Pea pull ups in the same size, which we used with our first born, and the Eco Boom pull ups are much softer and have a better fit. The Eco Pea ones leave imprints on our son's waist and have leaked numerous times, while the Eco Boom pull ups have a higher rise and are softer all around. Not a single leak with them. My only complaint is the price fluctuation. I've set up a subscription, but it's annoying when one order is $16 and the next $21. I'm very particular about nontoxic diapers and these seem to be great quality. On a single budget though, we have to be watchful."

A friend recommended these, which are totally chlorine free, and we\u2019ve been super pleased with them.\nOur toddler is 21 months, just potty trained, and wears the pull ups at night and during naps. We have the XL size in the pull ups, which are objectively smaller than the ones we used before in the same 6 size, but fortunately they\u2019ve been really absorbent. Our toddler is tall and almost 40lbs, and these will sometimes leave marks on her hips if she sleeps in a funny position, but they seem to fit well.\nEven if she pees multiple times overnight, we haven\u2019t had any leaking. The diapers do get cold if they\u2019re really full (as most do), but we haven\u2019t had leaks or wet spots. No diaper rash either.\nWe are really health conscious and shopped around for a brand that used clean ingredients and didn\u2019t have fragrances or bleach, and this is the one we liked best. Also love that it ships quickly and arrives quickly as sometimes a mama forgets to order, and this saves me the hassle of going to the store."

These Eco Boom training pants fit wonderfully and do not leak the same way, however, the liquid gets absorbed all the way to the outside of the training pants if worn all night. There is not protective too layer keeping the urine inside. This isn\u2019t a problem if he stays dry until the wee hours of the morning, but if he urinates within the first few hours of falling asleep, he will end up soaked and the training pants deteriorating. We will finish the package with the PUL cover on top and then continue our search for the best overnight non-toxic training pants!"

Even though my 3 year old I only weighs 26 lbs, she is tall and wears 4-5 T clothes. For overnight diapers she wears size 6 or in pull ups (4-5T). With this in mind, I got the equivalent size in Eco Boom. There\u2019s are huge! They are a lot longer than the other diapers and they are very in the front area though not wide enough in the bottom area. It fits very weird. My toddler also complained these felt scratchy. I am reluctant to try a size down because of them feeling scratchy to her. I will continue my search for overnight pull ups. These diapers may be true to the recommended weight; however, I don\u2019t think they would work for kiddos that are slim and tall."

The training pants are very soft to the touch, and fairly thick for training pants! The waistband and leg openings are very stretchy, but the waist is a little on the smaller side. Length wise, these do run bigger than I was expecting (especially for being size 5). My 21 month old is still under 30 pounds and wears regular size 6 diapers, but the bottom part of these training pants were slightly saggy and fit more like a size 7 diaper. The diaper themselves don\u2019t leak through like a traditional training pant, so these are truly more comparable to Pampers 360 diapers! The wetness indicator is accurate, and these do hold a fairly decent amount of liquid. Although these are saggy at the bottom, I haven\u2019t had any issues with leaks out the side for any type of liquid or solid. These are great for daytime diapers, but not for overnight. My toddler gets irritation rashes easily, but these are perfect for sensitive skin, and they\u2019re fragrance free! Even with being stretched out all the way, I haven\u2019t had any of these diapers accidentally ripping open during the day or while being pulled up- it does take a considerate amount of force to tear them off. The only downside is that there\u2019s no sticky tab anywhere on the diaper to keep it rolled up when it needs discarded. I think these XL training pants are great diapers for active infants and toddlers!"

My daughter is only potty trained during the day, so we only use them overnight. They contain her urine if/when she goes in her sleep. I'm not sure how they do during the day on a little one that is more active. They're a bit pricey ($43.99 at the time of this review plus a 5% off coupon), but that's to be expected for bamboo-anything."

They are a little bulky so depending on the size pants your child is wearing, they might give more of that diaper look than a normal diaper but if your child usually wears pants a little looser or a size up, then you won't notice it as much. It has great absorption and is perfect for when they're just learning and you want something they can pull up and down themselves for that sense of independence.\n\nThere is no scent to these which is great since I hate added chemicals to something going on my child's tush. These feel just so soft and must be very comfortable to wear and is a good in between diapers and underwear."

These diapers seem significantly larger than my current size 4 than I'm using. However since we're about ready to move to size 5, these diapers fit alright. It looks kind of big but that may just be the shape of it because feeling around and all, the diaper does seem to fit fine. I hope that helps figure out sizing for you.\n\nThe diapers seem to be soft and comfortable, no complaints or perceived uncomfortability. Handled a nice amount of urine, yet to have #2 yet but I'm sure it will be fine (can update review on a disappointing blowout should that happen).\n\nThese diapers are easy to pull up and easy to break to take off. The pull-up style diaper is better for comfort and easier to get on that your standard diaper, which is nice. If you're looking for an eco-friendly bamboo diaper, I am happy to recommend these!"

Not by much, but this has been helpful since my daughter is currently between sizes. The width is about the same. This brand is a little rounder, sSo it covers a little more of her bottom.\n\nThe stretchy straps on the sides are shorter on this brand, but they have more pull to them without being too loose. They're a little softer.\n\nThe absorbent area is similar in thickness and coverage, yet the brand name is just slightly softer. The difference is so small I don't think it matters. The brand name holds liquid a little better, but we haven\u2019t had any accidents and this brand doesn\u2019t slip off her bottom as easily when she\u2019s active.\n\nIf you don't care about looks (again, not a deal breaker here) these are pretty good compared to the brand name, they're better if you need a bit more coverage without going up a size."

They tear very easily from the sides, especially since I sometimes only have one hand to take them off and be prepared to clean up. They also hold a lot. Sometimes my daughter will go 2-3 times (#1) and when I take them off, they are so heavy but I'm shocked that nothing has leaked out! The only reason I don't rate them a 5 is that on more than one occasion, she has tried to pull them down and says \"it hurts\". So I don't know if they feel a little dry for her and rub up or something. We will usually take them off and apply a different brand and she's fine. Then we try again with these and have no issues. Not sure if coincidence or if she really doesn't like the feel of them at times."

We just started transitioning him from Costco size 5 diapers to size 6 so that\u2019s what we ordered. As shown in my images these size 6 are the exact same size as the Kirkland brand size 6. These are on the left with Costco diapers to the right. They are absorbent and very soft and Comfortable. We are just beginning potty training and like that these go on and off easily without stretching out or breaking down."

I got a size 6 because that's the size my son wears in his diapers and these aren't as snug. Since they are a tad bigger and haven't leaked I feel like they have very good absorbency. Will definitely be getting more of this brand."
