They don\u2019t leak at all, they don\u2019t make my daughter have a diaper rash and they are so soft and comfy. I love how they fit a bigger in size than Huggies or Pampers which makes more room for her chunky legs and tummy without having her feeling squeezed or causing leaks or diaper rash. We subscribed to a subscription via their website and got a free pack of wipes with every order. Great value for the money!! Also I love how Believe company donates diapers to families in need with every purchase. Great cause and outstanding product! Will forever be a customer!"

So, I will just tell you how they look, feel, and work.\n\nThere are a few companies out there doing this, so my comparison is with those and not the non-eco-conscious brands. They are on the softer side. Comfortable too. I haven\u2019t seen any irritation and we are almost done with the 35 pack we got. Initially I thought the wetness indicator wasn\u2019t there because it is so faint and made of three lines instead of a one solid stripe, but it is there, and it works. It does not come with any prints other than Believe written on the top. Size is true to fit. Tabs are good quality as well. The major plus is stretchable waistband and its very obvious unlike other brands when you pull on it. And the last but certainly not least, they have lasted for four plus hours when we went to the beach and forgot to change it soon after we arrived there, so it does its job. We haven\u2019t tried it for overnight though just yet.\n\nTwo downsides are, the tabs are not as longer as other brands, they only come around the side a tad bit, I don't think its an issue but having used other brands and having longer tabs that essentially meet half way around, I feel more secure that there is a less chance of blow out. Not that these haven't prevented blow outs but something I noticed that bothered me. Second is their price point is tad bit higher than your Honest brand and some other big brand which I expected but maybe it will come down in future as they do more business.\n\nI also like the fact that they have 1-to-1 matching program of diapers to a US family in need through Good+ Foundation.\n\nDon't forget to use the Smile.Amazon.com address - It's an Amazon program where many everyday things you buy will generate a small donation from Amazon to the charity of your choice at no cost to you.

No leaks from a very active kiddo. The waistband has a lot of elastic in the back, compared with other brands. These fit my kid well at the waist and leg openings.\n\nThe wetness indicator doesn't seem to work. There are 3 faint yellow lines, but they never changed color when wet. This isn't a big deal for me, as I usually check by feel, but my partner likes to actually look and see if it's changed color.\n\nI do like that this company donates a diaper to a family in the US for every diaper bought. That's pretty awesome.\n\nThese say \"Crafted in NYC, Made in China.\" I did a little research and it seems a lot of the eco-friendly diapers are made overseas. Even the bigger brands like Honest Diapers. So overall I'm pleased with these. If you're in the market for eco-friendly, sustainable diapers, give these a try."

They have very good stretch on the back and sides of the legs. I like that they are deeper on the inside so they do a good job at retaining liquid and holding in solids. They are lightweight and not bulky. However they do absorb well. They are very soft and don\u2019t have any sort of plastic feel to them. They also do have the wetness indicator. They are a very gender neutral diaper. They simply have the word BELIEVE on the front and they are white in color. I would consider these to be some of the better diapers we have tried. They work well and absorb well. I like them more than Luvs diapers. They are better like Huggies or Pampers."

These have pretty decent absorbency and comparable to our normal brand of Pamperss Pure. They are a little thin, but still seemed to work well for overnight wear and daytime. They do start sagging a bit if you go to long without changing diaper and diaper is really wet. The material is soft and I love that there are no chemical in these- they have no diaper smell like some brands have. Great for sensitive booties!"

The material is soft and there is a wetness indicator that shows through multiple thin lines versus a thick single solid line like other major brands of diapers. My newborn wet this diaper almost minutes after changing and it seemed to absorb just fine like any other diaper but I found the fluff of the inner material a bit on the thin side and not sure if this makes my baby comfortable or not. I'd like to think the fluffier, the better.

I love the soft white look, which is simple and won't be an awkward cartoon pattern, and the absorbancy, while not the greatest, is very respectable.

So I compared it with the Huggies little mover size 3 and found that the size 5 in Believe has about 2\u201d less stretch in the back waistband than the Huggies size 3!! That accounts for the inability to fit it on either of my diaper wearing guys.\nIt\u2019s too bad because they are really soft and probably would be really comfortable if the waist fit properly.
