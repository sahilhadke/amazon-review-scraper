These wipes are incredibly versatile, working perfectly on the face, body, and bum, making them a must-have for every member of the household. My toddler, who has eczema and sensitive skin, has never had any issues with these wipes, which is a huge relief.\n\nOne of the standout features of these wipes is their thickness. They are durable enough to handle messes without worrying about them tearing or separating from the pack. I also appreciate the design of the packaging, as it doesn't give me too much trouble when I\u2019m pulling out a wipe, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience.\n\nAnother great benefit is the value. The bulk pack is a fantastic deal, especially considering how well these wipes perform for such a reasonable price. Whether for cleaning up after meals or for quick on-the-go messes, Huggies Simply Clean Wipes have been a reliable, everyday essential in our home. Highly recommended!"

These wipes are definitely a standout in terms of both quality and price. Here\u2019s my detailed review:\n\nPros:\nExcellent Quality: These wipes are soft, strong, and don\u2019t tear easily, even when wiping tough messes. They\u2019re gentle enough on my baby\u2019s sensitive skin but still provide thorough cleaning.\n\nFragrance-Free: I love that these are unscented. Many wipes have overpowering scents that can irritate my baby\u2019s skin, but these are completely fragrance-free, which makes them ideal for sensitive skin.\n\nLeakproof Packaging: The flip-top packs are fantastic! They seal securely, so I\u2019ve never had any leaks or dried-out wipes. The design is practical and keeps the wipes fresh for a long time.\n\nGreat Value: For the price, you get 704 wipes spread across 11 packs. This is an amazing deal, especially considering the quality of the product. They last a long time, and I feel like I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth.\n\nNo Bad Odor: Some baby wipes can have a weird chemical smell, but these wipes have no bad odor at all. They\u2019re completely neutral, which is important to me as I want something gentle for my baby.\n\nVersatile Use: These wipes are not just for diaper changes! I use them for cleaning up spills, wiping hands, and even for quick clean-ups when we\u2019re on the go. They\u2019re great for the whole family.\n\nCons:\nSlightly Thin: While the wipes are strong, they are a little thinner compared to some other premium brands. This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but I\u2019ve found that I sometimes need to use two wipes for bigger messes.\n\nFlip-Top Can Be Hard to Open One-Handed: The flip-top lid is convenient, but it can be a bit tricky to open with one hand when you\u2019re holding your baby. This is a minor inconvenience but worth noting.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, I am very pleased with these Huggies Simply Clean Wipes. They\u2019re affordable, gentle on the skin, and do the job perfectly. The leakproof packs, lack of fragrance, and strong yet soft texture make them a great choice for anyone with babies or young children. I highly recommend them \u2013 you get a lot for the price and quality!"

I liked it so much I ordered a pack of them. These also come in handy when I have my nieces and nephews with me. Not only can they use it for their hands and face too, but also for their bottoms in public (I can too)! It\u2019s not super wet like other baby wipes, so it does tend to leave some pieces if you wipe your hands and then touch something while they are still wet (my black work pants in this case), but I\u2019d still prefer to wipe my bottom with these than other baby wipes. I also like that it\u2019s not scented, nor does it leave a chemical feel or smell on you like some hand wipes do."

I\u2019ve tried almost every single wipe out there and none seem to be this good and value for my money. They\u2019re soft but thick enough to hold up to\u2026well\u2026 blow outs. I love that there is not a scent and do not have lotion or other additives. The wipes are nice and thick. I always keep a pack in every room because they\u2019re great for also spills or a quick wipe down. Even my teenager uses these sometimes to wipe his face and hands when we\u2019re out and about.\n\nUpdate: I\u2019m deducting one star because Huggies has changed the thickness of the wipes. They\u2019re a bit softer but don\u2019t feel as effective as they used to be. Huggies- please go back to the original thickness!"

I just pulled out 3 sheets and all 3 were different sizes- see pics. so is amazon buying imperfect products and selling as if they are perfect ?

What actually happens it you can't easily get the edge if the first one and then a random number will be stuck at the perforation and come out together and then leave the next one non-grabable edge laying flat. When you actually need to use these wipes, that art of the system is very important to work right, however across multiple crates I have never seen one pouch work right.

Maybe a general use version of it would be quite useful as well!"

The pack contains 11 individual packs, totaling 704 wipes, making it a great value for money. The wipes are a lifesaver for quick clean-ups and diaper changes, especially when I'm on the go.\n\nOne of the standout features of these wipes is their fragrance-free formula, ensuring my baby's sensitive skin is not exposed to any unnecessary irritants. The wipes are gentle and soft, providing a comfortable experience for my little one.\n\nAnother positive aspect is their effectiveness in cleaning messes. They do a fantastic job of wiping away dirt and grime, leaving my baby's skin feeling fresh and clean.\n\nThe packaging design is also convenient. The wipes are well-sealed, preventing them from drying out, and the flip-top lid allows for easy one-handed access when dealing with a wriggling baby.\n\nHowever, one minor concern I have noticed on occasion is that the wipes tend to tear while pulling them out of the package. While this doesn't happen all the time, it can be a bit frustrating during those moments when you need a wipe quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, Huggies Simply Clean Fragrance-Free Baby Wipes are an excellent choice for parents seeking gentle and effective wipes for their little ones. The pack offers great value, and the wipes themselves are gentle and efficient. Despite the occasional tearing issue, I still find them to be a reliable option and would recommend them to other parents looking for convenient and fragrance-free baby wipes."

The contoured shape of the diaper fits snugly around the legs and waist, which helps to prevent leaks, even during playtime. The wetness indicator is also a helpful feature that makes it easy to know when it's time for a diaper change.\nOne thing I particularly like about these diapers is how soft and comfortable they feel. The breathable outer layer helps to keep my baby's skin dry and healthy, which is important to me. I also appreciate that they come in a range of sizes, ensuring that I can find the perfect fit for my little one.\nHowever, one downside to these diapers is that they are more expensive than some other options on the market. Additionally, they may not work as well for babies with very sensitive skin, as they do contain some fragrances and other materials that could potentially cause irritation.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Huggies Little Movers diapers to other parents, particularly those with active babies who need a diaper that can keep up with them. While they may be a bit pricier than some other options, I think the quality and reliability of these diapers make them well worth the investment."

Its very thin, very rough, and you will have to dig almost every other tissue, as they are not pulling one after another .\nI decided to save a few bucks, and regreated.

I don't like the wipes that have a heavy fragrance so I was happy to see that these were unscented.\n\nAlthough these are not antibacterial, they seem fine. They are durable and don't rip easy. They are multi use for us. We can keep our hands clean and also use the wipes on surfaces. We even have wiped down our Yorkie's paws with these when she got muddy. I think the price for only 64 is higher than other wipes though and these are no better than those. I will use what I have but buy wipes in larger quantities to save money."

I\u2019m going to buy a smaller pack to see if this was just a bad batch or if this is a permanent switch. If permanent, I will not be buying again. With that being said, the folks complaining about their box missing one pack are wrong. You get 11 packs not 12, each level has 4 packs so obviously the top level will have 3 packs instead of 4."

They are not very soft at all. They are strong and will hold up well, but they are a bit rough for delicate areas. He also freaked out when I tried these on his face. They are fragrance free, and don't smell particularly strong or anything but there is a slight unpleasant scent to them. I'm not sure if it was the scent or the texture/hardness to them that he didn't like on his face. (To be fair, sometimes he just doesn't like me wiping his face and it might have happened regardless of the wipe). I will use the remainder on myself or for other things, but not on my son.

I'm still torn on if the thickness is better than other natural wipes. My gripe with this specific wipe and I bought 3 boxes - there were many packs where when you pull out one wipe, the next one does not come up beyond the surface like what you expect with tissues. Given some packs were fine, I think there may have been some quality control issues. This makes it tremendously annoying when you really want to pull for another wipe but have to use both hands to fish out the next wipe. Because of this annoyance that happened in multiple boxes, I'd wait till after the QA issues to buy more"

But now, after 4+ years, they've changed the wipes. They are thinner and leave bits on my 3rd baby's bum. This happened when they changed the art on the packaging, and have Mickey riding a bubble. I still have some of the older wipes, and there is a definite difference. The picture shows the better wipes in the old packaging on the left, and the worse wipes in the new packaging on the right. (I tried to get a picture of the wipes too, but you can't really see the difference in quality. It's more of a feel thing.)

They were rather thick which I\u2019m sure would be alright for some but I prefer a little thinner, and they were also very dry. Which made cleaning rather difficult and made you use more than you really should have needed to use. I love the hard plastic closure piece though!

Now it\u2019s all I make him wear and I see why the hospital supports this brand. I love it. Definitely worth the value and my baby sleeps a lot better and keeps baby dry throughout the night. If you have a newborn, get these, and size up as your baby grows!"

Most \u201cnatural\u201d materials. Great diaper if your baby has diaper rash and closest to cloth diaper amongst most disposables\n-Doesn\u2019t have back pocket or but does have medium strength elastic and seems to contain #2s as long as there isn\u2019t a lot or they aren\u2019t too runny\n-Didn\u2019t have any fragrance added to diaper which I liked, less chemicals\n-Plain simple design\n-Straps are soft material and attach to diaper nicely throughout entire length of strap\n-Has additional side internal straps for extra durability for movement\n-Doesn\u2019t contain #2 the best if I forget to check for, say, an hour. You can see the brown color start to show through the diaper material, no official leaks though\n-Doesn\u2019t hold multiple #1s as well overnight (no leaks though) just feels \u201cdamp\u201d - it\u2019s possible it\u2019s just the gel absorbent that just feels cool to the touch\n***Personal rating out of 6 would be 3/6***\n\n~~HUGGIES LITTLE MOVERS~~\n-Overall medium thick material\n-Inside material is soft to touch (near identical as Snugglers) and more on the durable feeling side like the Snugglers/Mama Bear\n-Strong back elastic (doesn\u2019t have the \u201cpocket\u201d design) to catch #2s so they don\u2019t ride up\n-Didn\u2019t have any fragrance added to diaper which I liked, less chemicals\n-Mickey and Minnie Mouse design\n-Straps are soft material and attach to diaper nicely throughout entire length of strap\n-Has additional side purple internal straps for extra durability for movement (diaper is made for size 3 and up, not a smaller size in this version)\n-Contains #2 waste great like Snugglers/Mama Bear\n-Holds well overnight 8-10 hours (multiple #1s, haven\u2019t had #2 to test yet)\n***Personal rating out of 6 would be 4/6***\n\n~~HUGGIES SNUG AND DRY~~\n-Surprisingly on the thinner side overall (even though name has \u201cdry\u201d in it, I just imagined them being much thicker)\n-Inside material is soft (similar to Edens natural which was nice) to the touch yet feels durable enough\n-Medium strength back elastic (doesn\u2019t have the \u201cpocket\u201d design) to catch #2s so they don\u2019t ride up\n-Straps are soft material and attach to diaper nicely throughout entire length of strap\n-Didn\u2019t have any fragrance added to diaper which I liked, less chemicals\n-Mickey mouse design. Probably useless observation but it has a loud crunchy sound when working with the diaper\n-Seemingly holds #1s and #2s ok but not as great as the rest. Still gets the job done just fine though.\n-Doesn\u2019t hold as well overnight, but no leaks officially. Feels \u201cdamp\u201d after #1 sits for maybe longer than an hour. It\u2019s possible it\u2019s just the gel absorbent that just feels cool to the touch.\n-Ran the smallest in terms of overall fit, maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s called \u201csnug\u201d and dry?\n***Personal rating out of 6 would be 2/6***\n\n~~PAMPERS SWADDLERS~~\n-Size N through 2 seems to be a thinner material than size 3 through 4 from my testings. The thin versions are similar to Huggies snug and dry and the thicker versions are similar to Mama Bear\n-Inside material is very soft but was more of a mesh type of material verse thicker cloth type. After diaper changes it looked like the layers separated easily but still contained the waste just fine from what I could tell.\n-No back elastic or pocket at all to contain #2s. I have had to clean upper back messes with these diapers, I\u2019d say at least one #2 a day for two weeks straight of upper back clean ups with my daughter\n-Had a baby powder smell to them, which indicates an added fragrance\n-Elmo design\n-Straps are a harder plastic type of material that I would think is uncomfortable if it grazed my daughters tummy. Also, the portion of the strap that sticks to the diaper is probably only 1/3rd of the actual strap so I had \u201cloose\u201d straps that easily came undone when getting my daughter dressed if her clothes snagged onto the non-sticky part of the straps.\n-Doesn\u2019t contain #2s very well in my opinion, multiple leaks mainly in my daughters upper back\n-Holds up decent overnight 6-8 hours due to overall diaper thickness for multiple #1s (haven\u2019t had to test #2s yet)\n-Occasionally leaves tiny gel balls, doesn\u2019t seem to affect my daughter though in terms of any irritation\n-Ran the largest in terms of overall fit\n***Personal rating out of 6 would be 1/6***"

Had to order online as no local store carries preemie sizes. And I only found huggies and pampers even had a preemie size. My boy is now 6 lbs and I switched to newborn size. I would buy huggies again if needed. Recommend."

I have 4 children and 3 of them used these diapers and I still use them for my little princess. There is no irritation after using them, even if the baby wears a long time. Also, good absorption and do not leak. We have tried many different brands that are sold in our stores, from which we always had problems. Irritation on the baby's skin, leakage, etc. But after trying these diapers, we do not want to buy others. We forgot about sleepless nights, the baby crying from irritation on skin, etc. They are the best for the baby. Also, we tried Huggies little movers, but they often leaked and hung like a bag even if they were just a little full, which never happened with Huggies Little Snugglers. Highly recommend."

As a new mum I wanted to make sure we started out with the best (now we do Costco nappies :)) and so I kept ordering pampers. When we sleep trained our baby I needed something that would potentially see her through 12 hours without a change. She is very small - we sleep trained at 4 months and she was (and still is) wearing a size 2 nappy. This meant that she was too small for night time nappies. I bought a small pack of the huggies to try and they fit well AND last through the night! They are hands down the best nappies I have used (the costco ones are also very good. We use them during the day). We will keep using huggies as our nightime nappy and I highly recommend them to all! If you are in a similar position to us of needing nigh time nappies for a little baby who is too small for overnights, these nappies will do the trick! Do not hesitate!"

As a new mum I wanted to make sure we started out with the best (now we do Costco nappies :)) and so I kept ordering pampers. When we sleep trained our baby I needed something that would potentially see her through 12 hours without a change. She is very small - we sleep trained at 4 months and she was (and still is) wearing a size 2 nappy.  This meant that she was too small for night time nappies. I bought a small pack of the huggies  to try and they fit well AND last through the night! They are hands down the best nappies I have used (the costco ones are also very good. We use them during the day). We will keep using huggies as our nightime nappy and I highly recommend them to all! If you are in a similar position to us of needing nigh time nappies for a little baby who is too small for overnights, these nappies will do the trick! Do not hesitate!\n  \n"

I chose to start stocking up on them because I researched \"Mom's favorite diapers\" and it came up as number one. Also, it was the brand my Mom used for my brother and I. My husband and I purchased a couple large boxes ( we knew we'd get more at our shower), because we needed enough for our baby girl to be changed 10-12 times a day, which is the norm. When I had her I ended up favoring as for the newborn diapers the Pampers. That's what the hospital provided us and my cousin even got us a big box and I'm grateful she did. The way the newborn pampers fit and held pee, I felt were better for our baby girl. However, now that she 3 months and a size 2, all I like now are Huggies! I used mainly all Huggies size 1 and size 2 now for her of the Huggies, and they're way better fitting and hold pee way better than Pampers or any other brand is what I feel. I'll use Huggies from here on out for her. When we have our second child, I'll do the same routine that worked for us, newborn Pampers then Huggies size 1 up!"

The newborn - size 2s were wonderful, but once we got to size 3 we noticed that the diaper has more of a papery feel to it, like the Snug N Dry. It concerns us because we don't want to deal with soak throughs again, and so far we haven't, but we're afraid it's coming. As a note, we change him almost every 2-3 hours.The size 3s also come with a longer strip to fit around pudgy legs which is wonderful since our son is chunky. The Pooh characters are a nice touch and make the diaper look nicer compared to the Snug N Dry, but that's simply my opinion. I love these diapers and recommend the smaller sizes to new parents, but I think our love affair may be cut short :("

I just received our first box from Amazon and still have some left from Costco, and found that they are different. These are not as thick and are narrower between the legs. That being said, we haven't had any problems with them, in some ways I like them better because they fit a bit better but I don't know how they'd hold up through the night. I've been using the bigger ones at night because they seem like they will last longer.

The loss of one star is with the product itself, as I found them to leak often, especially if I'm not careful with how they go on DD. The leg holes are on the larger side, compared to Pampers Swaddlers, Baby Dry, and Huggies Snug & Dry plus, and they also seem to stay stretched (leading to leaks) when DD kicks and moves around a lot. I do prefer the softness and like the wetness indicator, but to keep from changing her clothes often due to blowouts and leaks, I prefer the Huggies Snug & Dry over the Little Snugglers."

                    "review": "Im a first time parent and am experimenting with some brands of diaper for my baby. I have tried kirkland , pampers, huggies so far.\n\nKIRKLAND\nKirkland diapers are the cheapest and if you can find it on a deal it's super cheap. The absorption of liquid is very good. And I have never spotted a leak from that. But those diapers have some design prints in the outside which is in blue color. It greatly confuses if the diaper has turned blue or yellow. Another drawback I found is the adhesive flap immidiately sticks to the inside of the diaper and makes it difficult to roll it for disposal. So I'd rate it 5/10\n\nHUGGIES\nThese diapers have the same type of adhesive flaps as kirkland ones. It doesn't seem to be that big of a problem, But the diaper gets swollen even before it is half full and baby starts feeling very uncomfortable on a single pee. Also the inside of the diapers has embossed pattern which makes imprints on the baby's skin.It has leaked once!! I wonder what solely is the purpose of a diaper So to me Huggies is a big 'No' . I'd rate 3/10\n\nPAMPERS\nSo far it is the best. The adhesive flaps are broad enough and elastic. The sticky tape is colored yellow, this is very helpful when changing diapers in the night light.\nIt has no prints to confuse with the blue line.\nIt also doesn't has any pattern. And pampers occupies less space than the other two I tried.\nAnd that's the sole reason it's a bit more pricey than others but I'd say it's totally worth it!\n9/10"

The first thing I notice was these did not come in the original packaging. I thought, 'Hey, they said they might not so fine.\" Then I noticed they are not as soft; they seem rougher and thinner. Third, they do not fit as well. They actually fit worse than the size 2. Last, they do not seem to be as absorbent and leak pee very easily. They should have come with a bottle of detergent for all the onesies I had to go through. I went to the Huggies website and none of the diapers pictured looked like these. And now, paying attention to this page, they describe and picture two different diapers. The little snugglers I like do not have the double grip and they have GentleAbsorb liner and not this DryTouch liner. Notice both these liners are mentioned. Unfortunately, this came with my first subscribe and save order so I can't get a refund. I do not know if this is all Huggies Little Snugglers size three, but I think I'm going to switch to another brand. Sad because I absolutely loved the size 2 version."

We\u2019ve been using the \u201cold\u201d ones for years and (stupidly) assumed the update was just to the box. Almost the entire box of diapers has hard crunchy things inside the diapers - like if they got wet, dried & sent to us anyway. They aren\u2019t nearly as soft either, which has always been a huge plus. As if that weren\u2019t bad enough, the cost per diapers has is significantly higher (increased cost for fewer diapers). Huggies have been our go to diapers, as we find they work best for our chubby babies. Hopefully we just got a bad box bc if the next arrives with the same issue, we\u2019ll definitely have to find a new brand."

I would regularly pull 3 inch long strings of fiber from around his privates and in his rolls. This seems like a health risk as they could hold on to the urine within a diaper that would otherwise be absorbed and potentially conteibute to infection if unnoticed during changing. I've seen at least one other review mention this issue, so I know its a problem for other people as well. Beware of this issue if you purchase. Im not sure if this issue is in any other sizes."

I felt like it was a bait and switch. Fast forward to Huggies, loved them after trying a box from the store. Size 2 from Amazon also worked well. We just got size 3, and the diapers are different! They arent as soft, the lining is different, they feel plasticky and I just found little crystals all over him. Considering theyre covering some essential parts, this disturbs me a lot. I have a giant box and another unopened one my mom ordered for him. Not sure what to do but I am not happy with Huggies or Amazon. Pics included, size 2 is on the left."

Not only did they push the price up they cut the number of diapers you get. (We would go through about 250-300 diapers a month). I have 18 month old twins a girl 19 pounds and boy 25 pounds. In have been using little snugglers since they came out of nicu and never had a problem with the older diapers. These new ones are terrible after a 45 minute nap she's soaked through. If it manages not to leak like a sieve in a hour the diaper starts seeping through and again leaving the clothes damp. Night time in these is not an option at all i was up all night every 45 to 60 mins changing diapers! My husband thought i was exaggerating so.... he got them on his day off all by himself. Half a day later he was on his way to get diapers at the grocery store.... and came home with every diaper not huggies.... i couldnt get them all in the photo my dinner table had been taken over by diapers.... Talked to huggies to see if there maybe was something wrong with the box I received was told to put them in next size up and guess what? Leaked even worse because in have a 19 pound toothpick in a sail. Thanks huggies.... In my opinion the crappy grocery store diapers hold way better and are a quarter of the cost. Cancelled my subscription and will never use these again. Still have about 130 of them left was thinking donating them but i dont want someone to be as miserable as i was! Huggies i understand keeping costs low but when you deal in baby products you can't cut corners..... how unethical can you be?"

We used Huggies lil snugglers at the hospital and they seemed fine. Baby was now 3+ months. Stared using Huggies and began getting a rash. Figured it was normal, tried normal solutions - barrier cream, baking soda baths, cornstarch powder, diaper free time. Nothing worked, started getting horribly worse. Thought maybe it was a yeast rash. Nope, antifungals didn\u2019t make a dent. Cortisone didn\u2019t make a dent. Doctor prescribed and even stronger steroidal cream, and that finally started to make a dent after 48 hours. This rash thing went on for over 2 months! Then our shipment of Babyganics arrived and we supplemented our Huggies stash with those. No lie, 2 days using the other diapers and the rash was completely cleared up. So then we figured it was just because we had been caring for the rash diligently and changing the baby frequently. Maybe the horrible rash had just run its course. Went back to the Huggies. He started getting a bit of a rash after day 1, worse on day 2, by day 3 full blown terrible rash. Switched back to Babyganics, rash gone. No special creams or treatments.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these things or if it\u2019s how they\u2019re designed or what, but they give my child absolutely terrible diaper rashes. We will absolutely never ever use these again. We used pull-ups (a Huggies brand) with my daughter several years ago and those were fine. But with these big name diapers the formulas are always changing and they\u2019re constantly replacing ingredients and materials to cut costs. Obviously some parent love Huggies. But if you use them and your child develops a horrible diaper rash, just warning you, yes, it\u2019s definitely these diapers. If your child has sensitive skin, I would advise not taking any chances with these."

Unfortunately, however, both times the Huggies little swaddlers I purchased from Amazon have been of notably poorer quality than those I buy at Kroger (which are, alas, more expensive per diaper). The Huggies I received from Amazon were thinner, fit poorly and resulted in poop leakage EVERYTIME! At first, I thought it was my technique but I have decided it is not since it has happened EVERYTIME with the Amazon-purchased diapers and rarely happened with the Kroger-purchased diapers. The diapers are clearly of poorer quality even by visual inspection. I am saddened by this and concerned that since it has happened with both boxes of diapers I tried from Amazon, that it is not just a matter of an accidental, isolated case of one bad batch of diapers. I canceled my Amazon diapers subscription and will buy my diapers elsewhere because the price on Amazon is not really a good price if the product is poor quality."

I used Pampers previously for my other two kids and was pleasantly surprised how Huggies stepped up their game. My most recent February order changed from the soft sage green Winnie the Pooh designs you see advertised to a more cartoonish whimsical Pooh design. The liner still feels soft to me and is quilted, but the size is smaller than the previous design's size 3 that I'd been using. I'm not going to knock the graphics. I think it's cute. But it no longer says Little Snugglers and the diapers leak like crazy. I would also have to go up a size for the diapers to fit my son next month, and this isn't right because I'll be having to pay more/diaper for the bigger size since the quantity is less. My son has woken up to soaked pajamas every morning - something that NEVER happened with the previous design. I'm lucky that he hasn't rashed up like crazy like other Amazon customers have experienced. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this new design of the Little Snugglers."

I ordered this large box of size 3 and apon almost being out of the pampers I got from my baby shower opened up this box. They are terrible. There is this purple strip on the location of where you affix the back straps to the front. It seems like it could be used to affix the straps better in theory but I can't seem to get them to work, the velcro just pops right off. So to get passed the purple strip I have to tighten the diapers passed where I normally would. But...minus the fact that my baby is plump and means I can't use these diapers for as long as I would like so buying the big box was wasted. ...also the strap that affixs to the front as rough sharp edges. I've seen diapers cut skin before and I can now see why.\nSoooo here I am in the mountains with a box of diapers I have to return and can't use (40$...), alone, with a son who was circumsised today so harder to drive to town with, and the new box of PAMPERS won't be here for 2 days unless I pay an additional 10 dollars. ..might just do that. At least I get to return these terrible ones."

The Huggies Little Snugglers worked fine in size NB and looked similar to Pampers NB. When we moved up to size 1, we used Pampers that were given as gifts. Once we ran out, I switched the dash button to size 1 and the look and feel of the diaper seemed different. I wouldn't mind except every time my son has had a poopy diaper, it has leaked out the top of the diaper! At first I thought it was because he was lying down, but it literally seeped out the top back when I was holding him sitting straight up. Other times it has leaked out the leg. It never fails that if it's a dirty diaper, everything else gets dirty. This only happens for poopy diapers; the absorbency seems to be better in the front of the diaper. I also don't like the way the tabs fold in because of the elastic waist so you can't use them to close it up before you throw it away. How I have a bunch left that I don't want to use. I'm ordering the Snug and Dry via the Dash Button and hope they work better."

After experiencing numerous leaks and blowouts, I now question the validity of these ratings. I can say, however, that the diapers I received appear to be defective- 1st package contained varying defects with tabs and lining and 2nd package had loose inner lining on left side of diapers. I surrendered following 1st diaper of 2nd package due to a massive leak at midnight, causing linens and garments to be changed (3rd time needing to change linens from diaper leaks in 1 week). I checked some of the other diapers in that pack and noticed the common defect. Therefore, I may have just received a bad batch, but the numerous episodes caused little desire for me to ever consider Huggies Little Snugglers again.

They were in the plastic sealed when received so I have no idea how this occurs.

I made sure everything was strapped on well and pulled out as recommended. Later on (first diaper change), I felt urine on me; somehow, urine managed to escape from the side of the diapers. The diaper was not even wet. I was flabbergasted and thankful that it was not #2 and I was home. Maybe because my son is rather slim and this is the reason for this epic fail but I am done and it's so sad because I received a large box of size 1 as a gift and I have to figure out what to do with them.

When changing our LO, since LO likes to try to roll diaper changes can be a struggle so I want a diaper that easily can be thrown on but with the purple tabs if the diaper folds on itself and it gets stuck and then tears when trying to pull it off the purple tabs. These are a horrible design and we will be switching back to pampers."

The first sleeve was fine, but when I cracked open the second sleeve anytime my son would pee even a little bit, the diapers emitted a horrible smell I could detect just by holding him. Tried another brand of diapers, and the smell was non-existent. Tried to give these the benefit of the doubt and opened a third sleeve of diapers- the stench was back!\n\nI've ordered Huggies from Amazon before and they were delivered in an official Huggies box. These diapers however, arrived in a nondescript cardboard box with sleeves of diapers. I don't think I'd ever order diapers from Amazon again.

I used to bought diapers more often from supermarket except this time. Comparing the Snugglers size 2 from supermarket with the size3 with blue tag from Amazon, the inside of absorbing parts are different. We know well the design of \"little bump\" is hard to FAKE and that is the best thing worthy of Huggies diapers for its good work on absorbs. The blue tag one has nothing with the design at all. I can say definitely the amazon one is FAKE! I will ask for compensation and return!!!!"

The front of the diaper is rectangular (without the contoured shape around the leg, or the side tabs at the front of the hips). The non-contoured shape causes them to leak around the legs! In the newer design, elastic was added at the back, and the legs are more contoured with smaller rectangular tabs. This is the reason Amazon is able to offer them at such a highly discounted price.

I have used a large number of different brands.\n\nHuggies are worth the extra pennies per diaper because they work so much better. They absorb better, they prevent leaks better, and with infants in particular, they prevent blowouts up the back so much better. The tabs are stronger, and stick really well.\n\nI've used the \"value\" brands and had things like the tabs tear off as I'm trying to fasten it on a wiggler. I've had them leak, I've had them come loose. It's worth the extra money up front to get the diapers that do a better job."

We haven\u2019t had any blowout's as long as I don\u2019t let him roam around after he pooped which is a no brainer and I can usually smell right away if he pooped, but unlike pampers, Huggies doesn\u2019t smell at all! My son and I cosleep and when he has to wear pampers at one point as a temporary thing until we purchased more Huggies, I almost puked the smell of pee after one pee is almost unbearable. The size is perfect it fits him so well that him being a very active 11 month old I never have to readjust or anything. The quality is amazing, super super soft and holds a lot of pee to the point I don\u2019t need to buy Huggies overnights! These work just as well overnight! They are super thick and hug his waist great! There isn\u2019t another diaper I\u2019ve found that has this much elasticity around the waist and coverage. Diapers are expensive nowadays but this price is great for the quality and quantity! I love the designs as well he looks super cute with the Disney charachters!"

Here's why I highly recommend them:\n\nFirst and foremost, the fit of these diapers is exceptional. They have a contoured shape and stretchy sides that ensure a snug and comfortable fit for my baby. The diapers stay in place even during active play, which is a great feature for little ones who are always on the move. I haven't experienced any leaks or blowouts while using these diapers, which gives me peace of mind.\n\nThe absorbency of the Huggies Little Movers diapers is impressive. They are designed to quickly absorb wetness and lock it away, keeping my baby's skin dry and preventing any discomfort. Even after several hours of wear, the diapers remain dry on the inside, which is essential for my baby's comfort and overall health.\n\nI also appreciate the quality of the materials used in these diapers. They feel soft and gentle against my baby's sensitive skin, reducing the risk of irritation or rashes. The diapers are also hypoallergenic and free from any harmful chemicals, which is a priority for me as a parent.\n\nThe Huggies Little Movers diapers have a convenient wetness indicator, which changes color when it's time for a diaper change. This feature is incredibly helpful, especially for new parents who may be unsure when to change their baby's diaper. It eliminates the guesswork and ensures that I can provide the best care for my little one.\n\nIn terms of availability and pricing, Huggies Little Movers diapers are widely available in most stores and online retailers. They are competitively priced, offering excellent value for the quality and performance they provide.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Huggies Little Movers Baby Diapers to parents looking for a reliable and high-quality diaper option. They offer a great fit, excellent absorbency, and are gentle on a baby's delicate skin. With these diapers, I feel confident that my baby is comfortable and protected throughout the day."

Let me share with you my detailed review of these diapers that have quickly become a staple in our household.\n\nI have tried and use many diapers before I came to the conclusion that I will not go back to any of those again.\n\nFrom the moment I started using Huggies diapers, I was impressed by their exceptional quality. The first thing that caught my attention was their softness. The gentle material used in these diapers feels incredibly comfortable against my baby's sensitive skin, preventing any irritation or redness. I've noticed that my baby seems happier and more at ease when wearing these diapers, which is a huge relief for any parent.\n\nAbsorbency is a top priority for any diaper, and Huggies has exceeded my expectations in this regard. Whether it's during daytime play or through the night, these diapers have consistently kept my baby dry. The advanced absorbent technology effectively locks away moisture, ensuring that my little one stays comfortable and rash-free. This level of dryness has undoubtedly contributed to longer, uninterrupted sleep for both my baby and myself.\n\nThe fit of Huggies diapers is another aspect that I truly appreciate. The snug yet flexible design ensures a secure fit that moves with my baby, preventing any leaks or accidents. The stretchy waistband and secure fasteners allow for easy adjustments, making diaper changes quick and hassle-free. As a busy mom, this feature has been a game-changer during those on-the-go moments.\n\nOne thing I can't overlook is the adorable designs on these diapers. Huggies offers a wide range of charming prints that add a touch of fun to diaper changes. It might seem like a small detail, but these cute designs have a way of making even the messiest moments a bit more enjoyable.\n\nAs a mom who values both quality and affordability, Huggies diapers strike the perfect balance. While these diapers are undoubtedly a premium choice, the peace of mind they provide in terms of comfort, absorbency, and leak protection is well worth the investment."

The resealable side tapes have never ripped off like other brands either (on those occasions I had to use other brands during emergencies).\n5. The wetness indicator for me is amazing especially when we're close to potty training or newborn age.\n6. I prefer buying through Amazon for convenience and the amounts of each pack they offer.\nLastly, all in all after trying so many disposable brands from the expensive honests to those that pamper... in emergencies now, if I don't have Huggies, it's cloth diapers.

Previously used Pampers Baby Dry and Pampers Cruisers for my 9 year old daughter that has autism.\n\nShe isn't non-verbal but Potty Training has been like war, the past 2 times we tried. So I've continued with a combination of Pampers Cruisers Size 7 and Pampers Baby Dry Size 7, until now. The Huggies size 7 don't have air channels like the Pampers do, but I've found the huggies to be bigger/taller, better fitting, far more absorbant, smell less than the pampers (when dry and when wet), be more comfortable than the pampers (based on my 9yo daughter no longer having meltdowns over diaper changes or when she goes to the toilet in her diaper.\n\nShe is able to wee/urinate in her diaper 4 to 5 times, before her Huggies will be full, and needs a change. No issues with going poo in her Huggies either, no blow-outs, no leaks, no tab breaks.\n\nThough one time, while I was changing her, she successfully managed to get one of her Huggies Little Movers Size 7 on her mommy's bottom, a testament to how big Size 7 Huggies diapers are I guess....\n\nThe thicker and longer wetness indicator is great and she doesn't leak overnight, with a fresh or dry diaper on before she falls asleep. She usually goes through 1 diaper a night but it can sometimes be 2 diapers a night. During the day, it's sometimes 1 but usually 2 diapers per day.\n\nThe Huggies size 7 also accommodates our daughters diaper alarm/humidity monitor, no problems (on the outside of her diaper, in between her legs, where girls begin urinating)"

The diapers are great at keeping in leakage, even when she's running around. They do look thin, so I wouldn't recommend them for overnight use. The curved and stretchy fit helps eliminate gaps at the legs and waist, making them perfect for active toddlers. The waistband and double grip strips provide a secure, flexible fit, and the fast-absorbing DryTouch liner keeps her skin dry. Overall, these diapers offer great protection during the day."

For some reason, the bulk pack of little cruisers in size 5 only doesn't have an indicator line, so strike 1 there. Huggies are definitely smaller and are more fitted. My baby has chunky thighs and when I tried huggies before they left red marks on her, but that doesn't seem to be the case now, many months later.\n\nI do have a few problems with huggies, like they aren't as soft as pampers swaddlers (which is what I use at night), they don't wick away urine as nicely, and they are a bit annoying to put on. The diaper flaps in the front always fold in and stick on itself, so I have to pry it apart while my active baby squirms to get up. And the diaper is narrow at the bottom and I find you need to be careful with that and make sure the seals are where they should be. But those are minor quirks and the diaper works great. I have yet to experience a blowout or leak with these.\n\nI think huggies would be better fitted for skinnier babies, but right now these are my baby's best day time diaper, which is a shame because huggies doesn't have a rewards program (unlike pampers, which I'd much rather use, but swaddlers don't cut it for day use without blowouts and I don't like cruisers due to lack of indicator line)."

We also experienced no leaks, no leg gapping, and the diapers reliably hold even sudden big pees or poops without any running.\n\nUnfortunately my baby's skin is super sensitive and the leakproof design means these diapers just don't breathe well enough, so she broke out in a mega rash every time we tried them. She's sensitive to the degree that only two brands of organic bamboo diapers have worked for us completely so far, so we are always the anomaly. It's unfortunate because these are great diapers that my sister in law raves about, but they just aren't going to work for us. They do fit great, are very soft, and have a wide size range so you'll get a good amount of time out of this size, but despite being really adjustable we didn't have any issues with ride up or loose fit.\n\nI'm happy with Huggies quality-wise but they really aren't for hypersensitive skin kiddos in my experience. Hopefully one of my kids will have normal skin someday and I'll get to use these because they're sooo affordable! For now, I do recommend these but mostly to parents who don't seem to have the same severe sensitive skin issues we do."

They run a little smaller than other Huggies and Pampers, and they are nowhere near being as soft as Pampers Swaddlers or Huggies Special Delivery. They do stay put really well for babies that are on the move due to the almost elastic like waistband, but that's not a big enough deal for me to choose these over Pampers... Especially since as of when I'm writing this they're the exact same price per diaper. I appreciate that they have the wetness indicator and the the Lion King graphics are super cute. These diapers arrived in 6 individual packs of 26 diapers each. While these diapers do the job they're meant to do, if I had to pick between these and Pampers Swaddlers at the exact same price, I'd have to go with the Pampers since they're just that little bit extra when it comes to softness, moisture wicking, and extra room."

Some key features of this product are:\nEliminates leaks for up to 12 hours (verified!)\nLiner Absorbs wetness on contact\nWetness Indicator turns from yellow to blue when wet\nFragrance free, lotion free, paraben free\nFree of elemental chlorine & natural rubber latex\nThese are great daytime diapers but as mentioned, I prefer nighttime Huggies or Special Delivery Huggies for overnight purposes.

They makes a big difference for us. I want my little one to be comfortable. At times you can see a red area maybe from the diaper scratching skin. They just don't feel as thick as before.

At one point, a year ago, I had 5 kids in diapers at the same time (two of mine are special needs and in diapers longer than is typical). So when it comes to diapers I am pretty sure ive tried them all including reusable cloth diapers.\nI'm cool with Huggies. They aren't the best of the best but they're a step up from generic. Generic diapers are fine if you must (and I do) - you just have to be more vigilant about changing the baby's because generics hold less and leak quicker than name brands.\nI can't see a price at the time of this review, so I can't say whether these are a good value. I use 7's on my chunky boy who is 65 pounds with a badonk that makes most diapers look like g strings on his thighs. Hes older, with a bigger bladder, so while pull ups do fit him better they seem more geared towards holding light leaks from potty training kids, not full on emptying the entire bladder. Diapers are better for that. Unless I want to use the night time diapers, which I don't because they rock but they're sooooo pricey when you have to use them during the day and not just at night. Anyways, back to these. These Huggies hold big bladders emptying without leaking. The 7's aren't as big as I'd hoped. They're the same size as the generic size 7's, which can also hold 1 full bladder emptying. I was hoping that because they stretch around the legs that they wouldn't be quite so tight on a chunky toddler, but they are tight. These can work better at night than generic size 7's, and they're cheaper than night time diapers.\nSo overall, would I reorder these? No. But thats because I try to be frugal when it comes to diapers these days (I've changed thousands upon thousands of throw away diapers). If you've only got 1 or 2 kids in diapers and can afford them then these will work for you fine. If you're on a budget, the generic 7's are the same size and can hold a fair amount of liquid before they leak."

I threw these on my 5 month so I can\u2019t say in terms how they hold up \u201cactively moving\u201d, but they do hold ( but keep in mind he\u2019s actually in size 2 diapers- so this may change when he enters size 3).

I change his diaper pretty often also so the leaks are not from not changing often. Another thing I don\u2019t like is the crunchiness of the diapers. Why are they so crunchy?! Other than those two issues they are a fine alternative although I won\u2019t be buying again."

The design is different and the extra velcro the purple band to help keep diaper in place on hip is basically falling off. they dont stay together like they should. They are thinner and less absorbent over all and the purple part gets wrapped up under the tab from not being attached right and gives my son a horrible rash/redmark on his thigh from it rubbing and chaffing the skin under it.

But because of the good name Huggies and I had tried their huggies overnight diaper before with no problems. I had ignored the horrible smell coming from this new pack of diapers when I opened the bag. I would always smell that horrible chemical sent when I picked up my 6 mths old old or blow bubbles on his tummy. But I kept brushing it off. My baby started having a slight wheezing sound on occasion and am like what could possibly make him start wheezing. Then i noticed he started stuffing his nose in the pillow each time i put him down to sleep. I found it strange. So today I decided to sleep next to him and go down to his level to smell what he's smelling. In his sleep he had wiggled his but close to my head and then the chemical smell coming from the diaper almost stiffle me with its obnoxious smell. My poor chunks was inhaling this constantly all this time. Especially as it's summer and I keep him in a onesy with no shorts on. It breaks my heart to know I am spending so much money on a diaper that his causing trouble for my son. I immediately took off that disgusting thing and lett him go bare bottom for now. I will go to the store tomorrow and try anothe brand. I will call the company tomorrow as well and let them know"

Our 1 year old who never gets diaper rashes broke out in a bright red and awful rash shortly after starting this package. We had been treating it as we would any other diaper rash, we used aquaphor, it didn\u2019t improve, tried desitin, no improvement, maximum strength desitin and still it appeared to only get worse over the following weeks. We took her to her dr earlier this week and she suggested and antifungal, absolutely NO improvement. It has continued to get worse. I finally told my husband I thought it was these diapers, we opened our pack of Kirkland and are putting these in the garbage, we looked into recent reviews on here-all from Nov and many complaining of similar rashes. We googled and there is a class action suit for chemical burns with Huggies diapers.\n\nI\u2019m so disappointed because I\u2019ve used these with good faith for all three of my children whenever they were on sale at Costco or whenever I was in a bind and needed to pick them up at a local store since my Costco is 30+ minutes away. We will not be using these ever again."

I change my twins' diapers every night before they go to sleep (regardless if they need it or not so they'll have fresh diapers while sleeping)\n\n2. My twins go to sleep between 8:30 pm and 9 pm and wake up every morning between 2:30 am and 2:50 am.\n\n3. I have to CHANGE THEIR CLOTHES 100% of the time because their diapers are completely bursting in the front and have drenched the side and/or front of their onesies.\n\n4. My twins wake up again by 6 am and require AN ADDITIONAL CHANGE OF CLOTHES.\n\nThis does not seem right. I did not have this problem with Kirkland brand diapers. I switched because of recommendations because the boys are tumbling and moving around so much during the day. However, this seems like a mistake.\n\nAlso, I never received 2 orders of diapers, and now have to wait 3 -5 business days to get my $105 back! Thank God I do not wait until the last minute to buy diapers or I'd be screwed. Amazon has a really bad habit of not fulfilling orders on time anymore. So not cool for essential items.\n\nGuess, this is more of a reason to switch back to Kirkland. I'll have to deal with the heat, because I'm not giving Amazon anymore chances to take my money and not deliver my babies' diapers!"

They leak often and even when they don\u2019t leak, the pee just saturates through the diaper and dampens her pants without actually leaking through the sides.

I have always used pampers but not always the pampers pure so I didn\u2019t think it could be the Huggies causing it. However, after continuing to break out into a rash and blisters I looked it up and there was as a lawsuit against Huggies just recently for causing blisters on some children due to unregulated levels of ahcovel. Very disappointed and only went through a couple days worth of diapers."

My son was taking a nap in my bed and woke up with a huge wet spot underneath him. Somehow the pee managed to completely escape the diaper as it was bone dry. It was secured to his body so I don't understand how this continues to happen. And even when the diaper does catch the urine, it soaks right through, leaving the outside of the diaper feeling wet.

They provide solid overnight protection, preventing leaks and keeping my little one dry until morning. The fit is snug without being too tight, and the absorbency is good enough to last through long stretches of sleep.\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t say these are dramatically better than regular daytime diapers with an extra absorbent layer. If your child is a heavy wetter, you might still experience some dampness by morning. Compared to Pampers Overnights, I don\u2019t notice a huge difference in performance, but I do appreciate that Huggies has a softer feel.\n\nOverall, a reliable choice for overnight use, but not necessarily a must-have if your child doesn\u2019t struggle with leaks"

We love the Huggies overnights, and normally just have them set to auto order.\n\nThe fit is great (she's roughly 38 inches tall and 32 pounds and size 6 fits great for her) and she's comfortable wearing them. They've never caused any rash or irritation. These aren't scented, which is what we prefer. The tabs have a strong hold.\n\nThe price is fair for the quantity and quality. It's rare we have leaks, as these hold a lot of urine. The longer ruffles these have around the thighs are awesome. If it's your first kid- make sure the ruffles are flared out lol. We have tried other brands that have good absorbency, but without those ruffles, they leak much easier than Huggies. Especially if your kid moves around a lot in their sleep!"

They are fantastic at keeping the bedding and clothes dry through the night, which means fewer laundry emergencies and better sleep for everyone.\n\nThese diapers can hold much more pee than a regular diaper, making them perfect for heavy wetters. On top of that, they were a lifesaver when my son had a stomach virus. I used these instead of regular diapers, and they did an amazing job at preventing blowouts during those tough days. The extra absorbency and secure fit provided peace of mind when we needed it most.\n\nThe fit is snug and secure without being uncomfortable, and the material feels soft and gentle on the skin. If you\u2019re tired of nighttime leaks or need a reliable diaper for unexpected challenges, these are worth every penny. Highly recommend for dry nights and more!"

These are working out better than the overnight Pampers (occasional leaks, baby can remove tabs, scented).\n\nI have read a lot about sizing up for night. Haven\u2019t had to do that, but I have always had to put him in the next size up once he gets within a few pounds of the lower limit (example: he\u2019s in size 6 but he\u2019s not quite 31lbs) because he is so delightfully chubby.\n\nHighly recommend (especially if Huggies is your preferred brand/fit of diaper) for leak free nights. Have seen great deals on Amazon around the holidays."

I would just recommend going up a size if you have a chunky baby.

Enter Huggies Overnites: the unsung hero of parenthood.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the competition. Pampers? More like Dampers. Those things leak like a sieve and the tabs snap off faster than my patience after a sleepless night. But Huggies? Huggies are the Fort Knox of diapers.\n\nPicture this: 2 AM, baby number three wakes up with that \"I just peed a lake\" face. I brace myself for the usual wet bed cleanup, but lo and behold, the Huggies Overnites have held the line! No leaks, no soaked PJs, no middle-of-the-night laundry sessions. It's like a miracle wrapped around my kid's bum.\n\nAnd the tabs! These babies are sturdy. Unlike those flimsy Pampers tabs that seem to be made of tissue paper, Huggies tabs stay put, no matter how much wiggling and squirming my little one does. I could probably trust these tabs to hold up a suspension bridge.\n\nSo, if you're a fellow dad tired of diaper letdowns, do yourself a favor and switch to Huggies. Your sleep, sanity, and laundry pile will thank you."

No baby should have to wake up with a wet outfit or crib sheets, and I'm at the point where I'll only trust Huggies to deliver on the promise of good overnight absorption to prevent that from happening. Additional pluses are that they don't irritate his skin and that there are regularly coupons here on Amazon to make them more affordable."

I have been in the habit of interrupting her sleep to feed and change her.\nWith these they are noticeably more absorbent and softer too. If your baby is sleeping for longer stretches even if their diaper isn't leaking I think these would be much more comfortable for baby.\nI think these would also be great for travel where you may be going longer than usual between changes or if they will be spending more time than usual in their carseat or stroller. The sides are softer and more flexible than the regular huggies.\nI will definitely be purchasing again."

We only use huggies diapers, and were sizing up for nighttime, but if the boys slept a little later in the morning, they would wake up soaked. We started using these night time diapers, and are still sizing up, and we never have leaks even with sleeping on their tummy. Make sure you are sizing up at least one size, sometimes even two sizes if they are on the cusp of needing daytimes upsized soon (ex. my boys are almost out of size 3s during the day and will be moving to 4s soon, and right now we are in size 5 at night). Even if they feel a little big, and the straps are overlapping, it is okay, just make sure the part around their legs are pulled snug!! Side note, its amazing these last all night because my one boy wakes up to feed throughout the night a few times, and my other two are fed with a feeding tube all night long. So these diapers are HEAVY in the morning!!"

When this started, we were having issues with him leaking out the front of his day time diapers and wetting the sheets of the crib pretty regularly, meaning extra laundry for mom! As a working mom, I don't have time to wash his sheets every day and didn't want to deal with buying extra sheets and changing them every day either, so we gave these a try! We haven't had a diaper leak at night since. Luck or coincidence? Maybe... but I'm thinking the diapers play a role. I hate spending the money on them since they are twice the price of our usual day time diapers, but that's the price for convenience and ease I guess. Overall, I'm just happy not to have leaks all the time anymore. If you're experiencing similar issues, I'd recommend at least trying them out! I also use these when we go on longer trips in the car to try and prevent any leaks or blow outs in the car seat."

The only time I had leaks has been if I forget to pull out the seam at each leg hole (run your finger around each leg of any brand of diaper to pull the ruffles out, to help keep the seal), if I didn't make it right against the waist and my child sleeps on her stomach or when I needed to size up. If you make sure to have the appropriate larger size for your child, pull the leg seams out, and make it right to the waist, then these diapers should hold all night. My child normally sleeps 10-12 hours. They hold it all. Great diaper. No complaints. I have been ordering these from the seller for about a year now. I just sized up to a 4 last month. I had been using sizes 3. Before that my child used to wake so often that I didn't need overnight diapers until she got to a 3 and started sleeping all night long. Try these diapers from this seller and I don't think you will be disappointed. The diapers I have received in size 3 still had the blue insert in the front of the diaper. The size 4 diapers are now all white on the inside with a mickey mouse design still on the outside. They still work even without the blue inner liner."

Twice recently, we\u2019ve had some serious leaks that have led to a load of laundry and stripped crib. The commonality in situation was that she seems to have wet the diaper while laying on her back. I think this is the case because she\u2019s wet up her back. The padding of the diaper is much more central and I think as the urine tries to pool towards the back the diaper just can\u2019t keep up where the padding is less. I\u2019m glad our girl doesn\u2019t wake up mad from the leak, but I feel bad finding her clothes cold and wet from the diaper not keeping up with her. I\u2019m diligent to make sure all ruffles and ridges are where they need to be. If you have a toddler (girl) who tends to sleep on her back, you may have some leakage issues. We will keep trying but probably buy a different option when these are depleted."

The only time it might leak is when my daughter sleeps on her stomach the whole night (~12hrs) and the front of the diaper has to hold all of it. Even then, leakage is minimal (my daughter is 10 months old) and it only gets on her pjs a bit-- never her sheets. I took away a star, though, because as some other reviewers have mentioned, these diapers make your baby smell like a truck stop bathroom. We've used multiple boxes now, so it's not just a fluke. We used to just use her Pampers Swaddlers when she slept, and after 12 hours they never smelled anywhere near as bad (they just didn't hold as much). I can usually already start to smell it if my daughter pees in these once. The smell just smacks us in the face sometimes when we walk into her room in the morning, and sometimes we'll swear she has pooped, but it is just pee. They also make the diaper pail smell so much worse. It never seems to bother her, though, and she is comfortable in them. So as long as they keep me from changing the sheets, I'll keep using them, but if any representatives from Huggies are reading this-- some better deodorizers would go a long way."

As wonderful as our daytime diaper was during the day, it just couldn't handle the volume of output during the night, even when I changed the baby right before putting her down, again when I went to bed, and sometimes again mid-way through the wee-hours. I tried Huggies Overnites first because we'd had success with the Huggies Pull-ups Nighttime for my older son. I started with the same size overnight diaper that my daughter wore during the day (3). They still leaked, not as much as the other diaper, but enough. From there, I went up one size, and now she is a much drier, happier sleeper. It seems she needed the little bit of extra height at the torso/waist to keep the diapers from leaking out, something she doesn't need during the day. We have had a couple of mornings where she's woken up soaked, and covered in the gel-like substance that is inside the diaper because the diaper exploded, but that has been the exception rather than the rule. Most mornings, her diaper is wet, but her clothes and sheets are not - and that's a HUGE improvement."

So at about almost 18 lbs, he's now wearing a size 4 and no more leakage. Again, if you have a tummy sleeper... size up. It will hold. *******\n\nAWFUL. I reallh wish I had read these reviews before purchace. My son is 17.8 lbs, we use size 3... and every morning he's soaked at the front. We are washing clothes more frequently because of this. To make it worse, I think just the regular Huggies size 3 diaper holds better through the night! Don't waste your money, please. Really don't."

We have used 3 different brands in daytime diapers, and they are all pretty consistent. DS is 14.5 months old, 24/25 lbs, and fairly tall and skinny (18 month pants don't stay up as well as I'd like to because the waist isn't tight enough), and has had bad leaks out the top the last 4 mornings in a row. This morning the whole front of his shirt was soaked (in a size 4). This has only happened when it's time to size up for us. The weight recommendations for size 4's is 22-37 lbs.

It's a bit unsettling, and while I understand that they're designed for overnight use, the sheer expansion left me and my babya little uncomfortable.\n\nNo Noticeable Difference (3/5): What's more, despite the extra puffiness, I honestly didn't notice a significant difference in terms of absorbency compared to regular Huggies. I was hoping for better overnight leakage protection, but it seemed somewhat on par with the standard diapers.\n\nPrefer Regular Huggies (4/5): Considering these factors, I found myself leaning towards regular Huggies. They do a commendable job in terms of absorbency without the overinflated feel, making them a more comfortable option for my baby.\n\nIn Conclusion (3/5): While the Huggies Overnites Nighttime Baby Diapers might work well for some, they weren't the right fit for me and my baby. The ballooning effect was a bit too much for my comfort, and the added absorbency didn't seem substantial enough to justify it. I'll stick with regular Huggies, which have consistently served us better."

We've had semi-regular leaks with Huggies too, so they aren't perfect (but my kid sometimes does drink a lot in the evenings, so we might be asking a lot of the diapers). This last box I got is worse, though, and most nights we've had the absorbent gel leaking through the top of the diapers. These have bigger Winnie the Pooh characters (like 3\" vs. 1\"), which I would have thought was just a superficial style change but the gel leaks have me wondering if there are other changes too. Might as well buy the cheaper store overnights based on our hit-or-miss experience!"

The \u201cgood\u201d kind have less stretchy sides allowing the diaper the retain better shape eliminating side leakage and the rounder Velcro tabs stick better.

These aren\u2019t absorbant enough.\n\nWhen I took them out of their packaging I was skeptical since my other Huggies diapers were thicker than these \u201covernights.\u201d The outside is less breathable and doesn\u2019t leak as easily (when it\u2019s not 110% saturated) as other outsides do because of that, but it isn\u2019t even as absorbant as the diapers I was using before.

So I decided to change him during the middle of-the-night feed (which I was trying to avoid so he wouldn\u2019t wake too much) and I\u2019ve still found that from bedtime to the feeding time he leaks urine out of the diaper. When inside his regular daytime diaper overnight he at least doesn\u2019t leak before the middle of the night change.\nThese are pricey and well-reviewed but in my experience they just don\u2019t hold up. The Kirkland diapers do better when I change one in the middle of the night. These don\u2019t even do well with changing once at night.\n\nIt\u2019s two instead of one because they are soft and fit comfortably. Plus it\u2019s not that they leak 100% of the time, but they leak more than the daytime diapers that I use which is silly."

When my 8 month old started moving more at night and having leaky diapers, I was having to change him and the sheets on a daily basis. I searched the internet for a solution and all the mommy message boards recommended Huggies Overnites. I was so happy to have found a solution until I went to buy them on Amazon and read the reviews. All the pre-2017 reviews are great, but apparently Kimberly Clark recently decided to change their product and the change is a big fail. Since there are no viable alternatives (Pampers discontinued their overnight diaper line and Seventh Generation's reviews aren't great either), I decided to give Huggies a try anyway. Just as the Huggies representatives keep suggesting to all the reviewers who complain, I decided to take their recommendation and buy my son a size 4 since he is right on the cusp of that size (in the daytime, he wears a 3). The first night it was fine--no leaks. The second and third nights, however, have been back to leaky diapers, wet pajamas and me changing his sheets daily. I guess since there aren't any great alternatives, Huggies decided they can get away with a lower quality (cheaper?) product than the previous version. In the meantime, I've had to buy some diaper booster pads. They're arriving tomorrow, so hopefully they work. Very disappointed."

I was having to change 16 Month old half way through the night so she didn\u2019t pee through. I was having to change her sheets every few nights because of her leaking through. Everyone suggested these so I decided to finally give them a try.\n\nMy little one sleeps through the night from 7 pm-6:30/7am. I\u2019ve tried these for a week now, and she\u2019s peed through every single night. I\u2019ve done laundry every day because I\u2019ve had to change her even more so than with regular Huggies.\n\nI really don\u2019t get it. We LOVE Huggies. They\u2019re the only brand we use after trying every single brand out there. They\u2019ve been the best. But these were very disappointing and such a waste of money. They\u2019re absorbent, but it seems to pool in one spot and then leak out.\n\nI was hoping to make this mamas life a little easier, but no such luck."

The gel is coming out of the diaper by morning and the tabs are barley hanging on. We haven't changed a thing. I'm tempted to go up a size in diaper but that would be for a 27lb-er and I still have half of a box of overnights left.

It\u2019s very clear the quality and standard has gone down with the company. Us parents would rather pay more money for a quality diaper, then pissing it away on something that does not work. Myself and about 10 other mothers notice this difference and will all be complaining directly to Huggies. It\u2019s very sad that the quality has gone down tremendously. and trust me us parents, we noticed. Now we will all be looking for new brands, and I will not be buying huggies anymore until the quality is back up to the standard It always was. I am canceling my subscriptions.

Tried one for the first time last night, and after having it on for 10 hours it leaked EVERYWHERE - by far the worst leakage I've ever had with my son. His sleep sack was drenched. I'd think that maybe I just got the wrong size, or he just had a lot of urine last night, so I would be willing to give them another chance - however, my son's legs and lower abdomen were covered in little pieces of shredded diaper, which appeared to be from the most exterior layer of the diaper disintegrating. This is completely unacceptable, so I returned the entire box of diapers for a refund. Never buying these again. I would rather have to wake up my son to change his diaper at 3am than deal with this ridiculous mess again."

She used to leak maybe once or twice A MONTH with the previous design. As she's gotten older, my daughter has stopped being a heavy overnight wetter, so leaks hadn't been a problem. I kept using overnights for peace of mind.\n\nBesides the new leak issue, I've noticed that the material, though seemingly softer, is thinner and gaps. The first night we used it, a whole piece stuck to her skin when I removed the diaper in the morning. (It came off quite easily, but still! The diaper almost disintegrated on her.)\n\nI'll be switching overnight diapers immediately."

Big mistake buying something on sale, which probably means not enough people are buying the item and they\u2019re trying to get rid of inventory.\n\nFirst, they fit weird. It fits perfectly in the hip area thanks to the adjustable tabs, but the thigh area seems really loose. Needless to say, my daughter constantly moves around on the bed and her pee leaked everywhere."

There is no padding to absorb our child's wetness. We have used these diapers three times and all three times they have soaked through. We like Huggies diapers and use them during the day time with no problems, but I don't know or understand what happened to the night time ones.\n\n07-11-2016, Just a follow up, after writing this review, the company commented on this review and asked to call customer service. My wife called and they were friendly and sent us a refund for our diapers and a label to send them samples of the diapers we purchased. That was three weeks ago, not sure if they will tell us if we purchased a defective product through Amazon or not. Hopefully they will respond."

To be fair my son is a stomach sleeper and sleeps very long, but the Pampers overnights never leak. So I had to buy Pampers overnights and am now using the Huggies Overnights during the day.

I finally inspected the diapers and found some hard pieces poking in the elastic around the back waist area where she's been itching, seems like some glue or something balled up in the gathers and poking through. No wonder she's been itching! Overall these new diapers are terrible and seem like they have issues beyond just being less absorbent.

As soon as I started using my first boxes of the \"updated\" Overnites for my 1.5 year old, I started seeing leaks almost every night. Most mornings he wakes up with a ridiculously full and wet diaper and wet pajamas. He's even in a larger size diaper than his weight would require (in the size 3 weight range but we use size 4 for overnight), so I know that size isn't the problem. Today when I got him up, the diaper had exploded and there were little absorbent crystals all over the inside of his zip up sleeper. That was last straw for us. I will not buy these again and will find another brand for his overnight diapers."

In comparison, the little movers leaked about once every 7 days. They also leave how skin feeling damp and clammy. Even though there well be a good 1/2 or more of unfilled diaper, they are leaking.

I have tried multiple kinds of Huggies, and my favorite, which I am loyal to, are the Huggies Little Movers that I get in bulk at Costco. The Huggies Little Movers are more absorbent than these \"overnight diapers,\" and you can even compare the thickness just by feeling both diapers as proof. I have to change my son in the middle of the night because he pees so much, and I am sorry to say these did not help AT ALL. These diapers are just a gimmick to get you to pay more for a worse diaper, and while using these diapers I still have to get up in the middle of the night to change my son because his diaper is so full."

I was using pampers swaddlers and even though I would make sure they were snug and completely covering him, somehow the pee would still make its way out of the diaper! It was incredibly frustrating because we were constantly going through outfits (both me and him because he would pee on my while I was holding him). I explained my situation in an online mom group and quickly found out that other moms were dealing with the same issue. They said they had switched from pampers to these Huggies and they no longer had pee accidents. So I ordered a box of these Huggies and tried them out. Sure enough\u2014NO PEE ACCIDENTS! This is now day 4 of using the Huggies and we have not had one accident or blowout like we did with the pampers. I\u2019m not saying the pampers are bad, but they just weren\u2019t suitable for little boys and their private parts. These Huggies definitely do the trick and I couldn\u2019t be more relieved. They are super soft and a little stretchy so they are comfortable my little guy. I\u2019m very happy and will be totally and fully making the switch from pampers to Huggies based on these reasons!"

USPS sucks in our area and quite frankly USPS workers do NOT appreciate delivering Amazon packages. Our USPS delivery person has outright REFUSED to deliver packages that are too big to fit in our mail box. I wished AMAZON would STOP shipping via USPS. Their service is subpar.\n\nthis is not a negative review about the product. Product is great. However, USPS delivery of AMAZON items is always a struggle with post office staff."

With the Huggies brand I don\u2019t have to worry about his discomfort nor any rashes , it fit him just perfectly. My only con is it being delivered but then again I don\u2019t have to leave my house to get them. Delivery is quick and efficient! There is enough room in this diaper for comfort and just so he innocent suffocating down there, easy to remove and put on. When full it does have the blue feature and honestly he is able to roam and be free due to the elasticity of the diaper. My favorite find!!!"

Here are my thoughts on all things Huggies diapers:\n\nHuggies Snug & Dry 12 hour+ diapers: 4 stars. Bottom line: GO WITH THESE ONES! These diapers are great! My child can wear them for hours and they do not leak or feel damp on the outside like other diapers. To me this is the most important factor in a diaper. We use these diapers day and night, (again, because they last through the night without leaking) which is cheaper than buying the Huggies Overnights usually by about 45%. Of course, at some point all diapers will leak, but my kids can stay in these all night (usually for about 13 hours) and during the day I change them usually in about 5 or 6 hour intervals--not because they need a new diaper at that point but because I like to change them before they get to that point. More liquid in more often means more liquid out more often. So the higher frequency of changes during the day is not surprising. In addition, they fit well, and the tabs are easy to undo and redo for adjusting to just the right snugness. There's no chaffing. They have Disney characters on them, which my kids like, and circles that show the size in the motif as well; so it's easy to identify the right size when switching to a different size.\n\nI'm docking 1 star because it is a little hard to tell on the packaging whether they are the regular Huggies Snug & Dry or the Huggies Snug & Dry 12 Hour +. You have to look at the picture of the box on amazon.com to verify, and the box Amazon sends usually looks totally different than the box in the picture. But, after years of ordering them, I am happy to day the right product had always been inside the box.\n\nHuggies Snug & Dry (regular, NOT 12 hour +): 2 stars because that's about how long they last until they leak. They do not feel damp to the touch on the outside of the diaper which is nice, but the bang for your buck is not worth it in terms of number diapers and laundry detergent due to the increase in loads of laundry caused by leaky diapers.\n\nHuggies Overnights: 3 stars because of price. They are too expensive. The Huggies Snug & Dry 12 hour + do the same job for significantly less money. The Overnights are true to their advertising though. They last through the night and fit well without leaking.\n\nHuggies Little Movers: 2 stars. I used these diapers with my first child for about their first 3 months of life. They often felt damp to the touch and had to be changed quite frequently. I would give them 1 star but their redeeming feature is the little line down the middle that changes color when your baby wets them, which let's you know they're wet. I appreciated this feature when I was really tired those forest few months and so was my baby. It took some of the guesswork out. By the time I had my second child I only remembered liking this feature and not how much I disliked the dampness that I tried them again. Upon using then with my 2nd child I was more experienced and did not find the changing color line feature do incredibly important. In fact we didn't finish using the pack we bought before switching to Snug & Dry 12 hour +.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please click the button saying so. Thank you!"

My kids were leaking through on a daily basis. I switched my youngest back to huggies, and I have noticed recently that the quality has been slipping. The past few boxes especially. My youngest has still been soaking through every few nights, and there is not all that much in the diaper. It seems like the diapers are just a little less absorbent than before. Nothing as terrible as luvs or store brand, but certainly not like they used to be. I tried the little movers and they are basically just pull ups with a different design, so I'd rather use these and get more diapers for the money. My little guy adores Mickey mouse, so he loves the design, but I would love for Huggies to go back to the good quality they were when my other two were in diapers, which was only a few years ago, my oldest is only 6. Like I said, they are still way better than other brands, but I am sad to see the quality slipping. I am having a lot more issues with the top of the diaper coming apart and the gel stuff leaking into his pajamas. He is within the weight limit and again, there is not that much in the diaper for it to be exploding. Kimberly Clark doesn't want to replace them, I had a box replaced years ago and that put me on the list of problematic customers apparently. I called and the person on the other line seemed annoyed and told me to buy a bigger size. The next size is much too big and stuff leaks out because of that."

As with all diapers, there are blowouts that you just can't prevent from getting everywhere, but these diapers limited the mess a lot more than any other diapers we have used.\nThere were only two issues that we had: if your baby sleeps the majority of the night like my son does, then these get really weighed down throughout the night. Most mornings he would wake up with pee soaked through his PJs because the diaper just couldn't hold everything through the night. I don't know if my son just pees more than usual or not, but the problem was easily fixed by buying a relatively small package of Huggies Overnites from Walmart for night time. The second issue we had with these was that they just aren't as soft as Huggies Little movers or Snugglers. My son has very sensitive skin so if we didn't change the diaper soon enough after it getting wet he developed a chaffing rash. This didn't happen with little movers. That being said though, they are great diapers for his sensitive skin as long as we get him changed often. They don't have a ton of perfume in them like all other brands out there, which is great. In fact, I don't notice any kind of added smell to them right out of the package.\n\nAll things considered, these are great diapers and they are the only ones that we buy for our son. He is a skinny boy and all other diapers just don't seem to fit him right. We have tried every diaper out there and Huggies are definitely our favorite. Great buy for the right price. And the subscribe and save delivery to our door each month makes it that much more worth it."

I used these diapers as a precaution because I have very sensitive skin and so does my son. I never had a diaper rash except two times when he had something sweet. So I live and learn. I decided to try Huggies in an attempt to save $10+ on each case. Well, I find the diapers are not quite as soft, however, the diapers work well. Just fyi, I do believe the chemicals in these diapers changed at some point during last years' production. Last year, my son had a few bad rashes back to back from one case of diapers I recieved from Amazon (I always order my wipes and diapers only from Amazon). So I started researching and noticed other parents complaining of skin burns and the diaper gel absorbent sticking to their child. I never had this issue before and decided to buy Aquaphor to protect my son's bottom. This saved my son's butt! Luckily, the small bleeding spots healed within a few days! I used Aquaphor all over his body until I finished this case without any more issues. I decided to try one more case without the use of Aquaphor and if the previous issue occurred again I would stop using Huggies wipes and diapers all together and switch to cloth diapers. However, to my surprise I have not used Aquaphor since and the Huggies snug and dry seem to have returned to the previous materials without any peeling and chemical burns. Very happy to have a diaper that is economical and provides good protection without leaks!"

I love that these diapers have no chemically smell like some brands (Luvs).\nThe elastic back. I love this detail! I was surprised to find that other popular brands (Pampers, Luvs) do not have this elastic back to hold messes in.\nThings I don't like:\nI wanted this to be my go-to diaper, however, I have had nothing but issues with the size of the leg holes. I don't know if my baby just has small thighs, or what, but I have had too many poopy explosions out the legs for Huggies Snug and Dry to remain my go to diaper. Nothing changed when I went from newborn to size 1, either, so I have to go with design issue. This is the only diaper that I have had this particular issue of leg explosions.\nI'm not ready to say farewell to Huggies, though, and I will be giving their Little Snugglers style another try after receiving a small package as a gift and loving them. Once I've used the Snugglers style for a few weeks, I will decide from there whether Huggies will be my favorite diaper brand or if I need to keep searching."

We'll still buy Huggies, for the daycare. He goes through a lot of diapers at the daycare as I suspect they are changing them out more frequently than we do (yes we're horrible parents) because I swear they keep asking us to bring in more diapers. So Huggies fits the bill for when you need a lot of diapers that have that wetness indicator.\nHowever, another problem I have with these is that they seem to fit smaller than the same size of Pampers. We use Pampers for nightime and those seem to provide more butt coverage than the Huggies of the same size. He came home one day from the daycare wearing a size 6 Huggies (not ours) when we had provided the daycare with size 5 of another brand. As far as I'm concerned he's a size 5, and fits Pampers and the Costco Kirland brand in those sizes, but we're getting size 6 in Huggies next time."

I switch between Huggies and Pampers depending on what I can get a good price on. The newborn Huggies seem to fit bigger than the newborn Pampers. At this point, my baby is still in newborn size so I can't speak for the other sizes. I like these Huggies Snug and Dry Diapers because to me they're easier to put on than the Pampers. I also hate them because every time I take the tabs off, they seem to end up touching the inside of the diaper before I can fold it up. I can't tell you have many times I have ended up with poop on the tabs. My husband also says that they smell. It does seem like the moment they are wet, you can smell the pee.\n\nNote: For some reason when I ordered a regular new box, they did not come with a wetness indicator (it does not show the wetness indicator in the pictures, which is fine), but I've ordered a couple of open box and they both came with the wetness indicators."

They would've never worked for my first who was long and lean, but they fit my second chunky little guy well. They also hold a decent amount of pee and no blowouts with them for us. The reasons I take away a star is that they aren't super soft, they are a bit more paper feeling, similar to a generic diaper like Up and Up. I also didn't love how thick they are, then they get wet, they swell quite a bit. The leg gathers could also be slightly tighter as when my baby was on the lower weight for the size they seemed too loose. Overall, they are decent diapers for their price point. In my opinion they are slightly better than a generic and a good price with subscribe and save. In the end, I prefer the softness and fit of the Little Snugglers and am willing to pay a bit more but will keep these in mind for sure if I'm trying to save money."

But if you're a first time parent, I would recommend buying the one with the blue indicator. They can be a bit more pricer but it's easier to visibly notice, especially when you don't have your sense of wet diaper touch perfected yet. Otherwise, this diaper works just fine and comes in bulk size you typically can't find in your local stores (walmart, target). One thing that I have been noticing with my son and not with my daughter is that urine tends to build up in the front (for obvious reasons) and that can create a strong ammonia (pee) smell. The odd thing is hat I've only been noticing this with Huggies...\n\nAs a side note, when you subscribe and save, diapers can be as low as 13 cents/count, which is great. But in my experience, you can get them cheaper if you use a combination of store + manufacture coupons and promotions in-stores. That's only if you have the time to do so. If you're like me, buying diapers online with the occasional coupon saves you time and you know you are getting a solid deal."

We had purchase several types/brands at the grocery to \"test\". These work great for us and we have not had any leaks/blowouts. The closure tabs are so wide compared to others and that is great for extra grip. The box that I received the diaper has a blue interior strip. Most diapers begin to get thinner as the size goes up so no surprise that these are not as thick as previous sizes. I do not care for the character designs as I am not big on many of the Disney creations, but that's not a factor just nit picking. We have not had any skin issues with these though he doesn't have sensitive skin. They do not absorb like a previous brand we used but we change asap so this doesn't affect us too much. There is no indicator strip as with smaller sizes but at 15 months he pats when he goes so we are well aware. The pricing is fine, I use subscribe and save and amazon mom."

These are my favorite huggies by far because they aren't so POOFY half the time I couldn't tell if he was full or needed to be changed cause his diapers always were just thick in genearl. These diapers are REALLY thin, like REALLY thin. So, if you are one of those parents that lets your kid walk around with saggy diapers for too long, this isn't the diaper for you, they will start to leak once they get full. Also, when he's been poopy I can't smell it. I don't know if it just masks the stink really well, this is great because I don't smell a stinky butt and everyone else doesn't either, but I go to change his diaper and wonder, \"Son, how long have you been poopy for? I couldn't even smell you!?\""

I opened both at the same time and can verify that with this particular purchase of this item, these are the same Huggies brand that I purchase and use routinely for my 9 month old. These diapers aren't knock offs and carry the same print as the ones that I compared them to. Huggies brand are the only brand diapers that don't break down my daughter''s skin. These diapers can and do leak if the elastic part of the leg isn't properly placed in the crease of the leg. Otherwise, I am able yo use these overnight for my daughter with very few wtting incidents. Taking price into consideration, this is a deal. In the local department stores, the largest box of Huggies you can purchase in size 5 is 96 count. I will purchase again and will recommend Huggies to all parents."

However, I only rated it 4 stars because before I had my son, there was an older version of this product that had more diapers in the pack and was a reasonable price. I don't know why they discontinued their larger pack and I'm finding that they did this across the board with all of their diapers. I feel it was bad taste that they did this during a pandemic when people are finding it harder to find much needed products at reasonable prices. To me it's greedy of the Huggies corporation to make less diapers in a pack and charge more for it. It's corporate greed at its finest and they clearly didn't have their customers in mind when they made their decision."

It's definitely better than the Target ones we started out with but I think Pampers is still better. Also, even though the size guide is exactly the same for weight but I find this to be a little smaller than Pampers. So if you buy this you might want to buy the bigger size if your baby is at the boarder-line between the 2 weight ranges."

So when i found this deal on the Huggies Snug and Dry with my prime i received a discount plus i had a coupon for downloading the Amazon app I paid .14/diaper on this deal which was outstanding for what i thought was going to be just as good as Huggies Little Snugglers but they arent. They are okay.... rougher feeling to them... when you touch them they arent soft they are the kind of material you can hear crunchy kind of sound. What is a plus though is these do have the pocketed back like the Huggies Little Snugglers... not as good of quality but still decent. So I rate 4* for price and pocketed back feature.

Newborns have more sensitive skin which is why I won\u2019t buy off brands for them. These diapers don\u2019t irritate my baby\u2019s skin.\nThey have a wetness indicator which is very helpful especially since newborn diapers don\u2019t smell so much.\nIf you care, they have really cute Disney graphics. Not like it\u2019s a dealbreaker to me, but it\u2019s a nice bonus.\nCons: they are kind of bunched up in the back which clearly does a great job at not leaking, however, when you want to change your baby\u2019s diaper, it immediately folds up which makes it hard to change diaper. Also I, if you like to use the tabs to close diaper before throwing out, as we do, and it bunched up, you can\u2019t do that because it\u2019s covered in.... yknow, diaper stuff.

We tried multiple brands: Pampers and off brands (Sam's Club, Target and BuyBuy Baby), and we ended up sticking with Huggies.\n\nIf you have a Costco near buy, and a Costco membership, about once a month they have the Huggies on sell for the same price as the Costco brand diapers. The only downside, is that I've never found the Newborn size at Costco and had to resort to Amazon.\n\nWe used these from 6lbs 9oz to 9lbs before moving to Size 1."

My reason for the purchase of these is because I was hoping for a slightly smaller diaper than the swaddlers size 2. I love pampers swaddlers but my babies are in between a size 1 & 2. My son leaks out of swaddlers size 2 a little at night we have to overlap the straps because they are a little big. We do the same with these diapers but so far he hasn't leaked out. My only reason for not giving a 5 star is the same reason I don't love any of the huggies diapers. It doesn't open up as easy as the swaddlers when trying to put under the baby. It also starts to fall down a little after a pee when my baby is crawling and moving around which pampers doesn't."

                    "review": "Intro: After five years and three kiddos I have used a variety of diapers including Pampers (Swaddles and Baby Dry), Huggies (Little Snugglers and Snug &Dry), Honest, Target, and Luvs. I personally only bought Honest, Target (Up&Up), Babyganics and Luvs a couple times because I didn\u2019t like the feel (Honest diapers and Babyganics are very stiff and papery) and absorption. That being said, I had found that Pampers and Huggies had \u2018premium\u2019 (Pampers Swaddlers and Huggies Little Snugglers) and \u2018regular\u2019 (Pampers Baby Dry and Huggies Snug & Dry) classes of diapers. I have compared these four different diapers - all in my current purchasing size (Size 5).\n\nPampers Swaddlers vs. Huggies Little Snugglers:\nFEEL: I love the cloth-like feel of both these diapers. Huggies were slightly softer than the Pampers, but only a tiny bit.\nWETNES INDICATOR: These both have the wetness indicator line (shown in yellow) which turn blue when the diaper is wet. This is not a necessary diaper function, but can be slightly helpful when doing a quick diaper check. Although, the line tends to almost immediately turn blue once the diaper is applied - but not necessarily enough to change the diaper.\nTABS: The Huggies diapers have better tabs - the entire tab is \u2018sticky\u2019 allowing for a quick stick on a wiggly baby.\nCOVERAGE: The Pampers diapers seem slightly larger overall, although not by much.\n\u201cELASTIC\u201d: The leg \u2018elastic\u2019 on the Pampers is wider, allowing for more material to catch a \u2018leg leak\u2019 - but the Huggies diapers are better for back-top leaks because of the waist \u2018elastic\u2019. These \u2018elastic\u2019 areas help the diapers fit and stay in place while keeping any leaks at bay.\nPATTERN: Both Pampers Swaddlers and Huggies Snugglers are fairly muted diapers, Huggies being slightly less noticeable under light colored clothing.\n\nPampers Baby Dry vs. Huggies Snug & Dry:\nFEEL: Pampers Baby Dry is much softer than the Huggies Snug & Dry diapers the Huggies diaper is very paper-like and this is a major reason I\u2019d prefer not to buy these diapers.\nWETNESS INDICATOR: Pampers Baby Dry doesn\u2019t have a wetness indicator line like the Huggies Snug & Dry.\nTABS: The tabs on the Pampers Baby Dry are not as big as the Huggies Snug & Dry; HOWEVER, the Huggies tab area is very narrow and thus seems more \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 when the diaper is on. Pampers tab is smaller but the design of the tab area seems much better.\nCOVERAGE: Pampers Baby Dry seems significantly larger than the Huggies Snug & Dry.\n\u201cELASTIC\u201d: Pampers Baby Dry doesn\u2019t have the back \u2018elastic\u2019 so the Huggies Snug & Dry is much better with back-waist elastic and the leg elastic afraid also wider than the Pampers. Huggies is much better at keeping leaks at bay with the \u2018elastic\u2019 areas.\nPATTERN: pampers Baby Dry are a much better diaper visually. They are a light blue and white color, whereas the Huggies Snug & Dry are a bold black and white which is easy to see under light colored clothing.\n\nOverall:\nSoftness (most soft to least soft): Huggies Snugglers, Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Baby Dry, Huggies Snug & Dry.\nWetness Indicator: Tie between Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies Snugglers, Huggies Snug & Dry - Pampers Baby Dry doesn\u2019t have the indicator.\nCoverage: Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies Snugglers (because of back waist \u2018elastic\u2019), Pampers Baby Dry, and Huggies Snug & Dry.\nPattern: Huggies Snugglers, Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Baby Dry, Huggies Snug & Dry.\n\nNOTE: I don\u2019t seem to notice an absorbency level difference between any of these diapers, therefore I didn\u2019t compare this aspect.\n\nIf money wasn\u2019t an option I would probably buy Huggies Little Snugglers. They are the softest, stretchiest, good coverage. My choice on the slightly cheaper diaper level would be Pampers Baby Dry because they are softer and have a better visual appeal.\n\n*** Please let me know if you found this review helpful but clicking the \u201chelpful\u201d button below***"

You'll see the most helpful review is from 2006! So please when looking over the reviews, I would suggest giving the most weight to those done since Spring of 2013 as those are actually reviews of the item that you are buying. Maybe Amazon can fix this with their review system, by purging/archiving the older and no longer relevant reviews that are for the old design?\n\nAnyway, it appears that Huggies has decided to have it's 'New Coke' moment and mess with a good thing by redesigning it's diaper at some point in the Spring of 2013. These diapers, as claimed by Huggies, are now thinner but still just as absorbent, which does not appear to be the case for my family or a number of the other families that have posted their experience here since the change was made; they're definitely thinner, but no longer as absorbent based off of our experience. We had been happily continuing to buy Huggies for the past 20 months, despite the price difference compared to other brands. We have stuck with Huggies because it worked for us. However, now that Huggies has forced change on us (a change for the worse in our opinion- yes Huggies rep: we will be in contact with you on your website), we are now in full experimentation mode and like other subscribers will be looking to other brands to get back the quality we were used to from Huggies. Unfortunately, at the time of this review we do not have an alternate suggestion for you. But if we find something that works for us, we'll update this review.\n\nUpdate (12/27/2013):\nI have bumped the rating of this review from 1 to 3 stars. It turns out that comparable diapers from various club stores are roughly as expensive or even more-so depending on the current set of coupons available. Plus, we got used to the forced design change (we had 100+ diapers we couldn't just throw out or return) and adapted our routine based off of the performance of the new diapers. In the end we stuck with Huggies. The diaper seem better now than our initial assessment, though I'm still not happy with how the diapers got introduced. Most likely, parents reading this review are not even aware there was a design change at this point, but it is still good to note that the post-Spring 2013 reviews will be most helpful to you (unless a future design change renders these reviews obsolete as well!)."

She came out of the Hospital with the other main brand and I wasn\u2019t going to switch if it wasn\u2019t for running out and the local store being out of stock. So, I tried this brand and never looked back. It just never spilled, no blow ups, nothing and I constantly had blow ups with Pampers. So, I guess all this time (she is 27 months now) I just have been lucky to have been buying the better kind. Decided to try this cheaper version, with 170 something diapers per box. Cheaper is never as good or better, right? Duh?! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It is 6 dollars less than the other one that comes with 120 something. Figured I would have to change more often, but not that it would fall apart. The beads just fall apart and kinda decompose on the baby once they get wet. Definitely not a 12 hour diaper. Reason why I give 3 stars is because it does not leak, even if she pees twice in the same diaper (she is 27 months old now). I think that is pretty good, but while it doesn\u2019t leak, it does sag, her skin is a little wet when it is diaper changes de time and as I said previously, the beads become lose and attached to her skin.\nThe review is for the diaper on top. The bottom one is what I am comparing to. The bottom one is great, none of that happens. It is like an indestructible diaper for 12 hours!"

We have used mainly Sam's Club Member's Mark diapers, but can't always make the long drive to the nearest Sam's Club to buy them. The struggle is real! We started out in the Pamper's Swaddlers and they were great. We got a lot of them at our baby shower. When we had to finally start buying diapers, we realized how expensive they can be and decided to start trying some other brands. So we have also used LUVS, which gave him what looked like a flesh eating disease on his bottom. We've used the Wal-Mart brand, Parent's Choice, and while priced decently, they left a little to be desired absorbent wise. The Huggies Little Movers have been good for us, but are on the pricey side. Anything for our little man though. So this is our first try with the Snug and Dry. While snug, whoch any diaper really can be if fastened correctly, we had our first ever leak in these diapers yesterday. He was soaked in the crotch and half way up his long sleeved onesie top. So, the one review I read about a boy \"peeing out the top of the diaper\" is totally a thing! I don't believe we'll be buying these again. We will be stocking up on the Sam's Club diapers since he JUST started in the size 5, and using the Little Movers when we absolutely have to spend the money on them."

Barely covers his bum. Also don't hold as much pee as the other Huggies so we have to change much more often. He wore them overnight (which is usually always fine by an early morning change with other Huggies brand) and ended up peeing through his jammies and onto the bed. He also had a bunch of the gel filling from the diaper all over his stomach/lower area. These Huggies are by far my least favorite of all the Huggies.

It is to the point where if we go out somewhere I do not put these on her because I simply cannot trust them not to leak. On numerous occasions, these diapers have leaked while out. Once they leaked through her pants onto my pants.\nThey are okay to use at home when you can change them as soon as your child pees or poops, however, they are not for heavy use. If you want a budget diaper, I would recommend Luvs (which is essentially the same brand anyway) they are about the same price and hold up much better.\nI canceled my next month's subscription even at a really cheap cost."

Some time in early May I noticed my 2 yo started waking up drenched. I thought wow maybe its time to go up a size but they still leaked like crazy. I found an old diaper in my diaper bag and compared them. The new style is much thinner and also must less absorbent. Last month I ran out of diapers and had to pick up some store brand diapers from my favorite \"Bulls-eye\" store. To my surprise when I switched to the cheap store brand diapers we had no more leaks. Obviously I'm canceling my subscribe and save and going with the cheap diapers now. Its a shame Huggies had to mess up a good thing. Their sure fit sure lost my business.\n\n***Updated 9/20/13***\nI do have to at least acknowledge Huggies for reaching out to me after leaving review. The new Huggies diapers are definitely not the worst, but they still are not as good as they use to be. A rep contacted me and explained the newer version now has less \"fluff\" padding and more super absorbent gel. This may be true but it doesn't change the fact they used to be better. That being said I have tried the other products and found that he Little Snugglers and cruisers seem to be as good as ever and far superior to the snug and dry. So maybe I will pay a little more for the good stuff."

The Velcro-style \"belts\" that allow the diaper to close have been coming off, or the diapers have been missing them altogether. I think that this is causing more leaking issues as well; I've been seeing leaking even immediately after I've changed the diapers.\n\nThese diapers are less expensive than others, but I'm not sure the relatively small difference in price point is worth it when a percentage (albeit small) of the diapers is useless."

So far Huggies overnight is closest to the prior making baby dry pampers. This may be good for size 1 or 2. I do not recommend otherwise. (PS.

My son gets yeast infections in pampers and luvs gets wet on the outside after one pee with him, so I\u2019m going to have to just use them until I find something else reasonably priced. He uses the Huggies Overnights because they are the only ones that doesn\u2019t leak at night and those are still great! They are still soft and do not have those hard lumps like the regular ones. New, but definitely not improved. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nI have used Huggies on all 4 of my kids and never had a problem until this box of diapers. The size 3 was so plush and soft, these size 4 are awful. They are thinner and crunchy. You can feel hard spots all inside them like they\u2019ve somehow got wet and dried. First bag out of this box was okay, But I noticed these were wrong as soon as I grabbed one out of the second bag. I opened the other bags that came in the box and they are all the same. Some are better than others, but none are soft and some are so bad that they actually crunch when you bend them. I\u2019ve requested a return for these and I\u2019m going to go buy a box from Walmart to see if this is a new Huggies design issue or an Amazon issue. I love Huggies and would hate to switch, but if this is the new quality then I won\u2019t have a choice.\n\nThe size 3 diapers have red dots along the sides of them and is super soft and nice, but the size 4 with the hard lumps has the diamond design along the sides and around the waist. You can also tell that the size 4 diapers leg and back ruffle is different. Size 3 is bigger and has more elasticity so it has a more snug fit, the size 4 is shorter and stretched out. I didn\u2019t noticed that on the first bag, but that could explain the couple of leaks we randomly had for the first time since using huggies."

These diapers, however, have inspired in me an unprecedented degree of frustration and disgust. I thought I was getting a really great deal on these. That is until I used them for a few days. These are NOT the Little Snugglers I'd assumed they were, which is what I've been using prior to this misguided debacle. As a first time mom, I was not aware that Huggies made a bargain basement grade diaper, but apparently they do. I realized these were not the diapers I'd been using as soon as I opened them, but I thought \"Hey, they're Huggies. How bad could they be?\" Brace yourself.\n\nMy baby is only 7 weeks, so she doesn't care, really. She didn't at first, anyway. As a matter of convenience, you'll want to be aware these don't have the nifty wetness indicators I've become so spoiled on. Which is not to say that you won't know when to change them. In fact, you'll have no occasion to wonder, as you'll find that upon exposure to moisture, the padding inside the diaper will instantly swell to a tell-tale puffiness twice its initial dimensions that will remove any doubt as to the status. That's only if you've managed to ignore your baby's irritated wailing or the spreading wet spot they're laying in.\n\nI rated them 2 stars because if you need a lot of diapers for cheap, these will certainly fit the bill. Just don't expect much in the way of performance. In fact, if you're after a great deal, I'm certain you could just scotch tape some premium paper towels onto your baby and achieve similar results. Perhaps you could just forego a diaper completely and simply stuff your baby's pants with wads of generic single ply toilet paper lifted from a lonely rural truck stop. That way, at least you won't have spent any money and you'll find the results not dissimilar.\nI pray that I am never on so tight a budget that I'd be forced to resort to these sorry diapers. Because in all seriousness, here's the real cost: four times today alone, I've rushed to find my screaming newborn lying in a wet spot, having soaked through her clothes and bedding, all of which have to be changed and washed. In addition, I've had to start using the Honest Company's Healing Balm (pricey, but effective) at every change, as she's been developing red, irritated skin because the diapers don't pull moisture away from her poor little bottom. I've never had this issue with other diapers. I change her frequently, so it's not an issue of the diaper overflowing or that she's left to soak in a wet diaper for long periods. It's an issue of these diapers being garbage."

I went to luvs , great price, bad absorbency, I was changing his diaper close to every 2 hrs vs every 4-5 with pampers. I used up the pack and waited a while before trying another brand. Note , pampers brand are still leaking @ times \ud83d\ude12 - so my fiance is like how about HUGGIES ? Now we thought about switching to this brand due to price but it was close to pampers so we said nvm - now we wanna switch for quality so we get a pack from the store. Love the design, they stretch SO good & absorbency is A1, haven't had a leak since I bought them I believe. Even if I did , I wouldn't probably let it slide just because of how comfortable they are for him & flexible. Plus I'm not betting on it , the absorbency is great. We came to amazon & they had a 200 pack- 200 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! Ordered these with the quickness and going to stick with em until I see wrong.\n\nUpdate 7/3/21- I have since switched. When your child goes to pee they will smell just like that- pee. I thought it was just 1 diaper. But it turned into ALL the diapers."

It's thin and lightweight, so I imagine it feels like you're wearing nothing, as opposed to the equivalent of wrapping a bath towel around your swimsuit area. However, if your child drops poop that rivals an elephant's output, I do not recommend this product unless you personally enjoy scooping copious amounts of human waste out of your child's pants and you have the ability to sanitize your home or vehicle like a doctor's office. It's a good thing my dog enjoys eating poop, otherwise this would have gotten a one-star review. I also had to purchase a box of candy canes to freshen my dog's breath because Dentastix don't work when you regularly feast on pounds of putrid toddler garlic butt mud. In addition, if your child drinks water and milk like mine, be prepared to change his diaper every half hour or you'll find yourself drowning in pee. One cup of juice, and this diaper starts gushing like Niagara Falls. Some people like getting peed on, but I find it less delightful. So, purchase at will, but if you find unappealing the idea of warm liquids and/or matter gushing out of your toddler onto your lap while you're trying to keep said toddler hushed at church, then perhaps you should rethink purchasing this item.

I've gone through this pack faster than I go through the ones I buy at Aldi because of how annoying it is to get these diapers to hold up.\n\nIf you do not adjust the straps to keep a tight a fit every hour, these diapers will leak in the sides if you child has runny/messy poop. These are definitely not diapers I'd recommend if you have a very active child that can cause the diaper to shift out of place and separate.\n\nTheir snugglers are much better if you want to stick with Huggies."

When the diaper comes off, the Velcro straps curl inward and rest inside, in the mess! They stick to the wipes, and to itself making it difficult to wrap up. And finally, these diapers are not very absorbent. It boasts of 12 hour protection. I wouldn't dare to leave it on for more than an hour, but probably even less than that. The diaper leaked. More than leaked, my baby was soaked through her clothes all the way up her back. And I had just changed her not that long ago, it's not like it was already at capacity. This happened twice!

I had roughly a dozen or so rip on me in two different cases. They would mostly rip along the tab that holds the diaper at the waist. No idea why but they just did. My son wouldn't even be fighting me half the time he could simply be laying there and it would rip when I was trying to put it on.\n\nMy other problem with ripping was sometimes when taking off the wet diaper the sticky portion would rip where it was connected to the diaper and then I would get some nice spongy pee all over me from the diaper. It would create a mess that my son just loved....\n\nI can say that these worked well for the most part and held up with my active toddler. He only once even got them off himself but with the two problems I listed above and the leaks we would get which I thought were just normal I went away from these and started getting the Kirkland ones which I have to say have never ripped on me or leaked even when wearing overnight which would always happen with the Huggies.\n\nI might try these again someday but I have to say they might not get my money ever again unless I find some new and improved version later down the line. As for now I will stick with the Kirkland even though they cost me pennies more and I don't get to sit around every month as the UPS guy brings them to my door."

I also unfortunately noticed that these diapers consistently leaked at night. I at first thought that I hadn't pulled the side tabs snug enough but after having my baby waking up wet night after night I knew it was not user error but that these diapers suck. These diapers may absorb more but they leak out some of the moisture that they've absorbed. I have some of the older version of snug and dry left over that I use at night but these \"new\" version I will only use during the day. I also noticed that these new diapers cause itchiness on my sons private parts I have to apply a bit more diaper cream to prevent him from having irritation. I don't like these new diapers and wish I could get some sort of refund otherwise I may have to switch back to using pampers. They cost a tad bit more but pampers in this case is a better product. I have Huggies on amazon prime auto-shipment but will stop any future shipment."

But I feel like the quality has gone downhill (or maybe just the size 6 diapers are terrible). I noticed a difference when they started shipping them in regular boxes (as opposed to a box like at the store). My son was over a year old at the time, and leaks and blow outs were very few and far between, so that hasn\u2019t been much of an issue. But They started bunching up and the lining of the diaper seems to disintegrate while being worn, even when dry. They are also thinner-I accidentally tore one while opening it up. Last month, I skipped our order, but ended up needing a few diapers to hold us over. I picked up the cheapest brand at Walmart. The difference in quality was startling. The Walmart brand diapers were much better than these. While the price point is great (and I have loved that discount) I will be canceling my subscription."

I had always purchased Huggies through a large wholesale retailer and have always been very satisfied with the product. I was introduced to Subscribe and Save shortly after the birth of my first son and was impressed with the great prices and convenience, so I decided to try it out. There is a VAST difference in quality between the product I buy at the large wholesale store and the product I received through Subscribe and Save. I tried out several Subscribe and Save shipments before deciding to continue buying the Huggies elsewhere. With the birth of my second son came a renewed desire to save some money, so we tried out the Subscribe and Save Huggies again to huge disappointment. My now 18 month old son pee's through the Subscribe and Save Huggies within 3-4 hours (sometimes in as short of a time as his 1.5 hour nap...) and my 3 week old son is pee'ing through his size 1 in about the same time, 3-4 hours. We do not have this problem with Huggies purchased elsewhere. So, I don't think we'll be continuing our Huggies diapers Subscribe and Save, because at the rate we're going through them we're not really saving any money at all."

And he\u2019s constantly leaking poop out the leg holes. I realize at his age the poop is still pretty liquid... but come on! Also, when he pees I can smell it. Obviously pee has a smell.. but I could never smell it when he wore the more expensive line. I will be getting rid of the 150+ of these I have left and switching back to Little Snugglers!"

I was happy that Huggies keeps him dry and saving my $$ for bulk order until I received my last purchase in size 2. They have been giving him a lot of leak, waist band breakage and horrible mess in diaper crystals.\n\nMy baby boy is now in 4 month and he sleep through the night for 8 hours. I bath him and change his diapers before he goes to bed. The 1st breakage occurs during the night (less than 5 hours after new diapers changed for the night) and second incident happened at his 2 hours afternoon nap (I always change his diaper before I put him to sleep). For the 3rd time, I was frustrated to find out that the waist band was burst opened again and leaving all crystals mess on him AGAIN. It wasn't pleasant to wake up and bath a baby at 4am. I'm going to unsubscribe my next order and start looking into other brand."

Will have to \"suffer\" through it. These diapers leak at night, even after only being on 2 hours, if my babies sleeps on her side, and pees or poos it goes right through the side she is laying on. The size 2 Up and Up diaper can be on all night and will not have this problem when she sleeps on her side. :/ I have done different sizes, my baby is almost 14 pounds, so the size 1 does not fit... I'm not sure how Huggies can correct this, and have seen similar reviews concerning the same issue... I will not buy Huggies again, they cost more then other diapers, and seem to lack in quality, which is a shame..."

The second box was just as bad. My son is only 25 pounds and the diapers fit snugly, but the absorption just isn't there. I even ordered and tried the little movers and they were no better.

So I had to buy a pack of little movers to put on her at night before bed so she can have a diaper that stays put all night.

They are much thinner, the elastic around the leg is much wider (might be a better fit for larger/heavier babies) and we had numerous leak accidents. Not going to 1 star it as they still do a decent job, but they required me to change much more often, which doesn't lend itself to saying that there are more in here than the premium ones, and thus a better value. We did find that if you have them sit a little lower than the waist, and thus fold a bit of the diaper over, that leaks were reduced. Again, this could be specific to our toddler's weight/build. She's tall and probably a bit skinny.\n\nThe box of Little Movers arrived yesterday and very happy for it. Despite the fact these are much cheaper and frequently have Amazon Mom coupons, I don't want my little one to have the potential for leaks"

The Snugglers diapers have a flap in the back that keep most stool from escaping up her back, but these do not. I have had to clean more mess & change more clothes in the last 2 days than I had the week prior."

I\u2019ve never had a problem with regular luvs leaking or soaking through during the night.

I want to be clear that this was NOT an allergic reaction b/c he had multiple actual bug bites, especially around his diaper area. Again, he was the only one in our family being attacked for about 3 mos before I realized it had to be the diapers. I also want to note that we stored the diapers in our home sealed inside the manufacturers bag until we used them and we keep a very clean house/ very attentive to detail. We continued the scabies/ mite treatment for about two weeks after we stopped using the diapers to be safe. We weren't seeing new bites and all his old bites were healing well b/c he wasn't relentlessly scratching them any longer. I had to throw away probably 2 packs of Huggies 172 count (still in manufacturers plastic bag/sealed) and probably spent close to $500 on various treatments for my son and my home b/c I did not know what it was at first so this Huggies negligence basically cost me almost $600, many sleepless nights, worry about what's literally eating my son, and lots of pain to my 2 yr old son. I will NEVER buy products from them or their Parent company every again !!!!\n\nOriginal review: My son got bites all on the upper part of his butt, i thought they were mosquitoes bites at first but new bites developed even when he wasn't playing outside and they were getting bigger and itched him so bad that he would scratch till he bleed. He was the only member in our house getting these bites. Nevertheless, I treated our entire home and backyard, spending a lot of money! I was also constantly treating him w/ 4 different treatments, he was getting sulfur soap baths twice a day and we also got medication cream from doctor...the old bites healed but new once kept developing. This went on for almost three months till I realized that the only thing it could be was bugs in his diapers since no one else was getting bites in our house and there weren't any bugs in our home either...I would search the beds almost every night when he would wake-up itching and screaming but would find NOTHING. I now know it's b/c the mites are almost totally transparent until they change color after drinking plenty of your blood, yikes!! It makes me wonder if there were also eggs and larva on the diapers which you definitely couldn't see. We will NEVER use ANY Huggies brand item EVER again!!!! I would give zero stars!"

Their Snugglers and Cruisers keep getting better, but I feel like they are purposefully making Snug and Dry worse to get us to buy the more expensive Huggies brands that come with a lot less diapers. I have 3 babies right now, and of both genders. These diapers are now paper towel thin, and I don't mean Bounty, I mean the crappy brown paper like thin you see in the grocery store bathroom! I am CONSTANTLY changing diapers, after 1 time of being peed in, they are falling apart, ripping at the seams, if they are peed in more than once by the baby, there are crystals EVERYWHERE, even when the diaper is no where near being full! All THREE of my babies are getting rashes from their diapers busting open in their sleepers and rubbing and chaffing them. I have never thought I'd see the day where Huggies would lose all care of quality in one of their products to get people to spend more. The more I have to change diapers, the faster I am running through the box and having to go out and buy more. Thank God I am a seasoned mom and I know this is not normal because I WON'T be buying these again! New moms may not realize that their baby's diaper busting open every single day, 3x a day isn't always the baby's fault, it is the diapers fault! I bought a 3 pack of generic diapers from the dollar tree to keep in my car for when I am out and about and those GENERIC diapers work SOOOOO MUCH BETTER! I don't want excuses, I don't want to hear it's the same absorbancy but thinner, because it is definitely not the same absorbancy, they rip like those thin brown paper towels in the grocery store bathroom, and they are now the WORST diapers I have ever used in my life! Not to mention the sizes are smaller now with snug and dry compared to cruisers and snugglers, I will not be buying any Huggies anymore! I refuse to keep buying more and having to go to the more expensive huggies brand every month because this company has lost all sense of morals, ethics, and pride in their products. Shame on you Huggies."

It is a shame to what huggies has come to! These diapers are so thin they do not hold anything. Now, I have to change my son's diapers three times through the night, and even then sometimes the mattress will be wet because the diaper does not hold. These diapers are designed for dehydrated children. They have been designed to make more money (as you have to constantly change them) not to help parents and their children to keep \"Snug and Dry\". I have a toddler and an infant and the toddler gets rashes between his legs because the diapers do NOT last and sag to often giving him a rash where the diapers rub in the inside of his legs, and I do change him three times more than with the old ones, and still these new ones do not last! Anyone who does not know us will think he gets those bruises looking marks because we are doing them while is the diaper!! I find myself changing more diapers throughout the day and night, more often then ever before! I do not mind to do what I have to do to keep my babies happy and dry, but this is not how huggies used to be! I do not appreciate huggies advertising a product that is false advertised compromising my children's well being. The good thing about this, is that I will run out soon enough and will not have to use them again. I am a subscribe and safe Mom for Hughes size 4, and size 2, but that will stop in a few minutes after am done writing this review, as I will stop my subscription. It is a real shame to look for ways to improve the way you can make money even if it is at the cost of these children and their parent's expense. I am very disappointed this is the way you thank your faithful costumers. This is the product you produce to have our beautiful, innocent little angels to use? We are talking about human being, about our children, the most precious thing in the world that you are putting in a position they should never be put into."

Throughout all the different sizes, she hardly ever had a leak.\n\nFast forward to May when I got my monthly shipment and they were the \"new and improved\" design. I first noticed that they were a lot thinner than the old version. The padding of the older version never bothered me or my daughter. They were comfy and soft and they WORKED! Since using the new ones, my daughter has leaked through more times in the last few weeks than she has in the entire year of her life. She has woken up many times from a whole night's sleep soaked through, but this hardly ever happened with the old diapers. The worst is when she is in her car seat. If she even has a small amount of pee in her diaper, after being in the car for 10 mins or so, I'd take her out and her entire bottom and legs would be wet through! This has happened on multiple occasions. I go through so many of these new diapers because I feel like I now need to make sure she has a new diaper before we go anywhere in the car. Her caregiver (who has three children of her own) has also told me that these new diapers \"suck\".\n\nI have read many reviews on here and it seems that the majority of people using Huggies in the past were happy with them, but that once the new designs came out, ratings have dropped and reviews are negative. I really wish that Huggies would listen to us and go back to the tried and true diapers that everyone loved. I was hoping that I could switch to Huggies Little Movers and get the same quality of diapers that the old Huggies offered, but it seems that all types are \"new and improved\". I will be returning my most recent shipment and now I need to find a new brand of diapers that worked as well as the old Huggies. I got a small package of Pampers, but they feel even thinner and I'm not sure how they will hold up. Has anyone tried other brands and found one that works well? My daughter is currently in a size 3, but is probably ready for a size 4. Any help would be appreciated!"

And his poor little bumhole looked like a ring of fire. He screamed in the tubby from the pain and I am angry that such a product is available. After this happened, I looked online and found that there is a class action suit against Huggies for this exact problem. I have requested a refund and I am returning the rest of the diapers. I have only used maybe 5 or 6 out of the 180. Thankfully, I stopped using the diapers and he is healing up today, but I can imagine that if these diapers are not eliminated how many children have been in the hospital from the reaction to the chemicals.\nAlso, on the Huggies chart, I only bought these because it looked like they checked the same boxes as lil movers or snugglers aside from the grippy velcro thing that I don't like anyway--says chemical free and fragrance free. This is not true-I thought my son had a #2 after he wet his diaper because the strange chemical smell that is emitted--my husband and I agree it smells like buttered popcorn in the weirdest way.\nWHAT the heck Huggies???\nAnd Amazon, why are these still being sold?

My little girl is a bit chubby and her twin brother is skinnier. These diapers are \"okay\" for over night as they do keep my babies drier and they don't wake up with terrible rashes due to being wet. But these absolutely suck for day time and awake use. As a new parent, I kind of rely on the wetness indicator. Which these don't have. These are so good at keeping moisture at bay that it's pretty much impossible to tell if my kids are wet or not unless they've had the diaper on for many hours; which by then, they develop a small rash and it's just painful for them to get changed. Even pressing my finger down onto it on a hard surface makes it hard to tell if these are wet. And I refuse to let my babies wear one diaper for 12 hours. Even IF the claim is that they will stay dry for 12 hours. Which is also not true. I'd give it about 6 max.\nNot only that, but the front cut of the diaper doesn't seem correct. It's like they don't fit properly. I'm either having to make the diaper way too tight to make the front fit properly, or it's too loose and we have blowouts or side leakage. This is on both kids, and for both pee and poo, so I know for a fact it's not me and how I'm changing them.\nIt says they protect against leaks, but I've had leaks out the sides and even soak throughs from in front. Not from one of them having the one diaper all night, either. It just randomly happens to soak through. So not only do I have a diaper change, but I have a clothing change as well.\nMy boy is a very wiggly and active baby, so a lot of the times when he's a tiny bit wet, he's also wet out the sides for the same reasons as listed above. NOT recommended for an active baby. His sister is pretty calm and the odd thing is that she has more leaks and blow outs than he does.\nEither way, I will not be ordering this product again."

I decided to try out the Huggies Snug & Dry diapers since they were on sale on Amazon - and now I know why they were discounted so heavily - because they truly do not keep your kid dry! They are paper thin, swell up very quickly, do not retain moisture, and leak every time! They even start to fall apart (ie beads start falling out everywhere) due to not being able to hold in all the moisture! And this is only with 1-2 hours of use! To put us out of our misery using these awful diapers (since we had a mega huge box of them to still get through), I ordered different (more reliable diapers for our son - LUVS - yes, cheap LUVS!) and we used those during nap time and night sleep times, then designated these diapers as the \"day time use only, preferably when you know there isn't going to be a poop\" diaper, until we finished them off! Perhaps these might work on other babies/toddlers who are not heavy wetters, but they did NOT work at all for our 2 yr old heavy wetter! I recommend using either LUVS or Huggies Snugglers over the Snug & Dry! They both are better, in the same size. Although, unfortunately & sadly, even LUVS (& Pampers) diapers have recently been downgraded in quality due to the manufacturer trying to save money, but even they are better than this diaper! Maybe that is what happened to this diaper before we tried it, too :( I have a feeling it's going to be harder and harder to find a good quality diaper anymore these days..."

Amazon, please look over the reviews since Huggies changed their diaper. The reviews for this diaper should not be combined with the reviews from the original snug and dry diaper as it is NOT the same product. Your subscribe and save customers should not pay for and receive anything but the product they originally ordered. Huggies is dragging your name through the mud right along with theirs.\nThese have been the only diapers I would ever put on either of my girls, until now. When I first received this last box of diapers I thought they seemed awfully thin but then never thought much more about it. So when my daughter started wetting and messing through her diaper I just thought time to go up a size, even though this was never an issue with my older daughter. After all it couldn't possibly be the brand/diaper I had for so long in-trusted. So when my baby started getting diaper rashes, which she never gets, I just figured it must be from her teething. Until no matter what I did; oatmeal baths, baking soda baths, creams/ointments, corn starch it kept coming back and with a vengeance. Finally I took her to an expert (my mother) and after leaving her bare bottomed or in bloomers for the entire day it started clearing up. When bedtime came and I discovered I had no diapers in my diaper bag. I reluctantly used the \"off brand\" diapers my mom had. To my surprise the next day the rash was gone. After returning home and placing one of her\" Huggies\" on her the rash was back by the very next change. Thats when I figured out it was her diapers this whole time. What really gets me when seeing all these reviews. Is that huggies knows about all the issues and discomfort these diapers are causing. They leave comments stating the same thing after every one star review. Yet continue to sell them, promote them as the same product. (you too Amazon) These diapers should be pulled from store shelves as they are causing great discomfort for babies. Huggies you need to pull up your pants and take this one back to the drawing board or better yet go back to the original. SHAME ON YOU HUGGIES!"

I actually laughed to myself and said WTF happened to this diaper as I pulled it out of the box thinking it was a random messed up diaper... and I pulled out a few more and realized that they all are just THAT THIN!\nThen I thought maybe they had a breakthrough in some super crazy absorbing material and thought I\u2019ll give them a try.\nAFTER ONE PEE the diaper is wet to the touch on the outside. Yes after wearing them for 20 minutes they are seeping through and it\u2019s not even close to full or saggy, after one pee she came to sit in my lap for stories and I could feel the moisture on my leg of the pee seeping through the diaper!\nThe last 3 nights, My little girl has woken up crying multiple times each night and in the morning because the bedding is wet, and she\u2019s wet and cold. I\u2019ve never experienced this with a diaper, not even with cloth diapers. I am so so so very pissed.\nThese are going back."

But the ones I ordered from amazon my daughter's butt turns red. The diapers frays into little tiny pieces and suck on the babies skin. The package box wasn't the one showing here, it's a brown box with huggies logo on it.\nWell, of course the price is much better on amazon plus the subscibe and save, it's even better. But it just doesn't work if the babie,s butt turns red.\nI found a good deal on Walmart.com, but the same thing happened, the big packages have good prices, they don't have them available at the physical store, so I ordered on Walmart.com. The same exact thing happened to me. The diapers came in a brown box, my daughter's skin turned red again after using just one diaper.\n\nI spent a lot time did my research, found out that most of the physical stores has only the smaller package, which is very expensive if you divide them per count. But they all have bigger packages with better prices on their store website. Like Walmart.com, target.com, BabiesRUs.com. Etc. so far I've tried Walmart.com, it seems to b a defective batch like I ordered from amazon. Haven't tried other store web sites yet.\n\nMy conclusion is: there's no bargain, if you want a good product, you got to pay the price.\n\nI just have one question for the manufacturer, how do you distinguish the good batch and bad batch? Do you make a cheaper version at a lower costs and only selling them on line?\n\nMoms, if this product doesn't bother your baby's skin, it's a good choice considering how much cheaper than the ones in the store"

I had this diaper on her when she was in a car seat, so sort of in the seated position. She pooped a lot. When I lifted her up immediately after, her clothes were clean. I carried her to the changing station and put on her back to change. By the tome I took off her one piece suit, all pooped leaked all over her back. I thought perhaps it was an isolated accident, but the same happened again and again. This diapers simply provide zero absorbency for poop.\nI previously tried Target brand diapers and they worked better keeping poop from leaking on the back. Unfortunately, Target brand has lesses protection from leakage the sides.\n\nAlso, this diapers are rough. They feel like they are filled with fiberglass. No wonder Huggies doesn\u2019t want to disclose what material they use. Even Target brand was much softer than these.\n\nOverall, not a good diaper. Poor value for the money.

As soon as my child pees even a little, the diaper automatically turns into a deformed diaper from the inside. The cotton inside breaks into a few clusters of cotton and if you dont change the diaper soon enough it will release all the urine onto your child's clothes. I was suprised to see that whether used or not, the diaper is very bad quality even if my child only has it on before it becomes a dirty diaper. I normally buy Luvs since they are less expensive and lock wetness pretty well. But they are not as popular as Huggies which was shocking to me. I guess ill be going back to other diapers.

Every time i change his diaper the gel is in little balls all over the place and it takes forever to clean them off of my baby. I cant use them overnight unless i wanna change his diaper every hour or two.\n\nAnd im back to add to this review with more bad news. Turns out the stuff that absorbs liquid comes out of the diapers before even using them. Im halfway through the second pack of the three packs of diapers and i just noticed these tiny hard white dots coming out of the diaper. Like a hard powder. It gets EVERYWHERE. I hate these diapers. But I assumed i couldnt return them since i was already at the end of one pack by the time i noticed this problem the first time. I just went back to Luvs. Never had any issues with them and they are way cheaper. Save your money and get yourselves some luvs."

Our boy almost never had nighttime leaks, and now it happens 80% of the time with the \"new improved\" version of this diaper. They still work OK as daytime diapers where the child can be checked frequently but you can buy less expensive diapers for that purpose. What the manufacturer says about the new diaper is almost silly, where they claim the new thinner version should be just as absorbent as the old due to there being more absorbent material. They apparently didn't take into account the RATE that the diaper must absorb the piddle! My feeling is that the old version with more padding could take in and distribute the piddle faster and therefore keep the child dryer. You would think they would have thoroughly tested this new design, but maybe they only tested with toddlers who didn't drink much or weren't boys!\n\nThe manufacture has been requesting that we call in and discuss this problem with them, and I did so. They were very nice and interested in hearing my story, but unfortunately didn't indicate that they had a solution. To me this is very reminiscent of that time many years ago when they came out with \"New Coke\" and claimed it was better, but everyone immediately could tell is wasn't and revolted!! That was one of the biggest blunders of a company in years and is used now in training classes of an example of a bad decision. This change to Huggies is similar. They took a 4.5 star rated product on Amazon and \"improved\" it down to a 2 star rated product!! I suspect a few Huggies employees are in the hot seat now for this decision!"

This is the SECOND time that I've received a shipment of Huggies brand diapers from Amazon that smell like pure gasoline. Now, I am religiously applying multiple layers of diaper rash ointments on poor baby's private area and bum. I figured the first time was just my imagination and just experiencing some weird olfactory senses malfunction.\n\nI have no clue what is stored at either distribution's warehouses or of the set up, but for infant diapers to reek of gasoline coming out of the box and plastic wrap packaging is more than disheartening and concerning to say the least.\n\nI certainly hope that my daughter doesn't experience any future complications or adverse effects due to this incident...Now I am stuck with a brand new box of diapers that I don't even want to bother to return (as what's the point to sending it back if it will get destroyed or sent to someone else and this happens again) and an upset baby who can't get comfortable at all. I hesitate to order any other brand of diapers from Amazon as I have no guarantee that I won't run into this issue again. Disappointed that I may have to give up the subscription discount as the products offered on Amazon were in larger quantities and cheaper for the discounts compared to retail stores."

Ive been buying huggies for my daughter since she was born..I would typically buy them from the pharmacy so when I signed up for Amazon prime and saw that I could get them a few bucks cheaper and the convenience of being delivered to me i went ahead and signed up for a subscription. Now when I recieved my order I saw noticed that it came in a Amazon box instead of a huggies box but I didn't make a big deal about it. The first night I noticed that my daughter had developed tiny red bumps on her lower back where it has the little folds in the middle of the diaper. That's never happened before so I thought it could've been a minor irritations rom something else so I put a bit of a&d and continued to use the diapers and monitor it. After a few days she was scratching and very uncomfortable and the rash was huge and it covered the entire lower back area of my baby girl. I heard some rumors about fiber glass being found on some of the huggies products and that was causing rashes and normally I wouldn't really believe that but now I don't know what to think! I called Amazon to complain and they are issuing me a refund but this is completely unacceptable on huggies behalf! Hope this review helps and informs u moms and dads out there."

I have both a son and daughter and Huggies have never worked for either one. I must be glutton for punishment but they were out of Pampers and we all know running out of diapers is a parental crisis :-) so I thought I would give them one last shot. I'll be contacting both companies and if you have any other brand recommendations I am all ears.

After treating it for 10 days, the area only got worse. We changed to Luvs diapers that she was on before Huggies. Within 24 hours the area started to look better. It is now a week out and still has a red area, but is getting better. I googled Huggies and any possible recalls, but there was none. Now I am stuck with about 200 diapers that I can not use. Huggies should recall these diapers, put a warning out, and refund my (our) money we are out. With my search, I found a parent showing pictures of their baby's bottom using Huggies diapers, and it looked identical to my baby's injury. Per the parent's complaint, she states the cause was due to a chemical burn from the gel packets inside the diapers that is activated when urine come in contact with it. I am just glad my baby is doing better now, but never to buy Huggies Brand again. Please keep your baby safe!!!"

Not sure what else they changed, but am now in the process of finding another diaper since these will no longer last through the night despite boating 12 hours of dry. I have been ordering these purposefully without the wetness indicator because the snugglers just didnt last as long. Also these leave chemical beads on my son's bum when the diapers are barely wet. Now that they are the same as the diapers with the wetness indicator, what else can I do besides switch to a brand without it? It does seem like these are lower quality diaper packaged specifically for amazon to offer a 20% discount for a inferior product. The diapers look similar EXCEPT for the pictures on the outside images and there is some sort of code on the okd diaper. Again this makes me question the authenticty of the diaper. The new version is pictured on the left and old version that worked is on the right. I just can't help but feel like they lowered the quality to just sell on amazon. I will also take a picture of the diaper after an overnight use for comparison and edit the review in the next few days."

These diapers dont come in retail packaging but rather in brown cardboard boxes like the boxes you see on the second column. I've been using Huggies from the local Walmart and Samsclub during the last 3 years for my baby and never had any diaper rashes. The first time I bought it from Amazon about a year ago my baby developed rashes the first time we used them. These rashes are not from being allergic but from wearing the diapers just for about 3 hours without it being wet. We had to change her constantly to use up all these diapers. I thought we just had a bad batch or something. On Black Friday I was shopping online and thought I would give Huggies from Amazon one more try. These Snug and Dry are definitely thinner (less paddings) then the local ones and you can tell they are different because the ones from the local store have purple gluing tape and these ones have white gluing tape. We went ahead and try it and to my dismay my baby developed diaper rashes again just from the first day using it. I would never again buy Huggies from Amazon. I will not even use it even if it's for free !"

Sometimes I read negative reviews & I don't have any of the problems they list so was hoping they would be wrong but as others stated the diaper is extremely thin, like half the thickness of any other diaper we have tried. She leaked every single time & I change her at appropriate intervals but with this diaper I started to change her twice as often & she still leaked & the diaper sagged like it was so heavy even when the diaper was half as full. It would pull down on her stomach & was like a big glob of wet toilet paper, hard to explain but not at all what you want. The diaper also didn't pull the wetness away from her skin so she instantly got a rash. I can't say enough good things about the Little Movers & the Overnites so I won't try switching again."

Also, the outside of the diaper starts to feel damp after awhile, and my son wets through them much more quickly than the previous design.\n\nWorst of all, today was the first time since my son was a newborn that I actually had to scrub poop out of his clothes because it leaked all over the place. Not happy with these at all. I have been a loyal Huggies customer for a year and have spent hundreds of dollars so far AND I was planning to use them until my son potty trains and on our future kids.

Yes they were thinner than the Huggies diapers that we had been buying from Costco- the only reason I bought these on Amazon is because we live so far from the store. I thought it would be nice not to have to take up lots of space in the car hauling diapers. I have 5 kids and have used Huggies for years and love them, but this new style is terrible. My kid has been waking up in puddles every day. Even if the diaper is only used for a short time and not completely full, I feel it leaking through the diaper when I change him. I hope this is not the same thing that Costco is selling now or I will be switching to another brand that has not lowered their quality standards.

Our Snug & Dry Diapers with SureFit Design are a more flexible, less-bulky diaper that can absorb as much as a thicker diaper.

Definitely, we did not get a bad batch.\n\ncorporate false claims these days is common place. and this manufacturer in particular talks about donations, business ethics, concern for the community, ownership and the such.\n\nIf you care to read their bull, you can find it here (spoiler: get ready for a good laugh)\n[...]\n\nHow exactly are they\nAccountable: We take ownership for our business and our future.\n\nor do they\nCaring: We respect each other and care for the communities where we live and work.\n\nwhen they blatantly lie by making surreal claims?\n\nMaybe they tested their diapers on baby mice or they deprived their \"subjects\" of water so that they can claim the 12 hour leak proof. Disgusting."

I ordered the month supply (SMH) First of all, I noticed you can feel the pellets in the diaper- like you're holding a small bag of sand. EVERY SINGLE DIAPER leaves these tiny gels all over my baby's butt. It's already difficult to change my little one but she now hates each and every diaper change cause these leave her with diaper rash and I have to use 3-4 wipes to take off all the who-knows-what chemical off of her. At first I thought it was just a few bad diapers as I was using a mix of pampers and huggies but I stashed the pampers away and used the buggies exclusively and consistently HUGGIES leaves a trail of gels pellets. I change my baby often too! The first 6 months I used pampers swaddlers and she never had a diaper rash. Never going back to Huggies and throwing out the rest. I've rather spend more money buying Pampers/Honest."

When we made the decision to be a bit more financially savvy and not spend so much, I purchased this box of Huggies because they were much less expensive than the Pampers, and Huggies is still a great brand.\nThe diapers work fine when it comes to holding in pees and poops. The problem is that ALL the pee seems to go into one area of the diaper and creates almost a WAD, and my son looks ridiculous walking around with this giant, sagging butt. Seriously, I know he's 2, but this diaper ruined outfits with how low it hangs. And my son found them uncomfortable - he would grab and swat at his butt and thighs when the diaper got really heavy.\nThis is definitely a case of \"you get what you pay for\". The Pampers Cruisers don't sag, even with several hours worth of pee in them.\nThumbs down, Huggies."

I'm left to wonder if there's a money back guarantee. I previously purchased Huggies Little Movers which were wonderful she was never wet in the morning after a nap or at any time during the day.

Loved the absorbency and the fact that this diaper easily lasted through the night and through at least 3-4 hours during the day (and my boy is a heavy water-drinker!). Everything changed when Huggies came out with a \"new and improved\" design (aka Leak-Lock system) in April 2013. The new super-thin diaper is anything but leak-lock or absorbent! My son has been waking up completely wet every morning (which means almost daily laundry for his pajamas and crib sheets), and unless we change his diaper every 1 or 2 hours (at the most) during the day, it's going to leak out as well. I'm sure anyone who's ever changed a 2.5 year-old's diaper will relate to just how \"easy\" it is to get a toddler to stay still for such frequent diaper changes. I'm going to give it one more shot and try out these diapers one size up from what my son currently uses, but based on everyone's reviews here, I think we may need to start looking for something new in a month. Sad to give up on the formerly trusted brand (although, incidentally, the Pure & Natural diapers are still as good as they used to be, and I'm currently using them for my 2.5 month old)."

The crystals have been falling out and peeling off on him a little bit over the past few weeks but this was EVERYWHERE- all over his body and jammies. It is clear that Amazon or Huggies are cutting corners on these and they are a lower quality diaper.

They can no longer be used over night. I compared the new version with the old, using them both at night. When you press your finger to the old diaper it feels slightly damp. The new diaper feels soaking wet when you press your finger to it and is extremely flimsy.\n3. The new diaper leaves a lot more whitish residue on baby's bottom and genitalia. And it does not clean off easily. I assume this is the material breaking down from being wet.\n4. The tabs tear off very easily and don't stick well.\n\nHuggies has slowly made their diapers worse. They had previously removed the nice curved tabs that worked well and the pocket in the back to stop a large BM from escaping. The absorption was still good so I kept purchasing them. With the new changes, Huggies has lost a customer.\n\nThe new diapers do not sag in the bottom at all. If looks are your only concern, and you don't mind changing diapers every hour or so, these are for you. I say give me back the sag and diapers I can use all night."

My kiddo ( 14 months), isn't too concerned about having something be the most plush material out there, but this diaper is paper thin and very stiff, almost like a tyvek suit, and the absorbency gel comes out and can be found on my baby's bum after just a couple hours. It's doing enough of a job to not be causing any diaper rash, but the sides are pretty coarse and have caused some red marks on her, as she is walking and sitting down all over now ( lots of moving ).\n\nI don't know why this pack was different than other Huggies Snug & Dry that we've had, but it not only had different packaging, (with no confirmation that it doesn't have bleach, perfumes.. etc), it also seems to have a much lower quality over all."

This has been one of my worst experiences.\nWe opened the first package while we were camping. They were ok during the day. Because it was cold, when I put him to bed I put flannel pajamas on him, plus two fleece sleep sacks. He slept through the night. When he got up in the morning, the diaper had leaked, not just around the legs or at the top by his belly, but through the entire diaper. He was soaked through his diaper, pajamas, and the first sleep sack!\nThe second night, because I didn't want a repeat, I put a second diaper over the first. That night he only leaked through one pair of pajamas.\nI have these stashed in my car for the emergencies where any diaper is better than none. Although, not much better."

As soon as he pees just a little bit you can feel the moisture on the outside of the diaper, they don't hold the shape so they get loose around his back very quickly. I was already one of those parents changing his diaper almost every hour but now more because it leaks so easy and also noticed in several changes it left lent on his private area !

They feel cheap and I wish I would have sent them back before using any cause now I'm just trying to quickly go through them by changing my baby's diaper more often. He has got more diaper rashes since using these also. No pee leaks but plenty of poo leaks at the back of the legs if not changed immediately although the snugglers are the same there for us. If I could I would buy only the bambo nature diapers or andy pandy brand is the best if you're rich... Also I just hate the tacky print they use. It shows through any light clothing. Why not use something trendy/classy? I'm switching back to little snugglers even if they're more expensive..."

Too many unnecessary blowouts to mention and simply because the diapers are not made wide enough to cover the baby's bottom appropriately. Secondly, the back of the diaper scrunches up and does not lay flat as you try to place the diaper underneath them to put one on. And most importantly, one of the last diapers from the box I ordered, stuck to my child's bottom and peeled the skin which caused bleeding. There was no previous diaper rash in the area to have caused any oversensitivity, nor had the diaper been on too long, as I change her diligintly. Frankly, I expect more from the Huggies brand.

I have to change their clothes at least once a day because they leak terribly! And they wake up way before morning because their clothes are soaking wet!!! Take my advice and steer clear of these. I have put up with this for several days now, and I can't take it anymore. I would love to throw the rest of them in the trash, but I'm not the type to waste money. I will be so glad when they are gone!! I can't imagine anyone liking these. Maybe they are ok for tiny babies that don't urinate much, but these are no good for 18 month olds."

That is a lot of changing and washing instantly because I am nursing and didn't want the clothes to be stained. I have had a blow out every day for the past month and I didn't want to buy new diapers so I just used the left over ones I had but as of today Im giving them away and going to Costco.

We found some older diapers we had stashed around the house and compared them to these new ones and noticed right away that they were totally different . We stopped using them on our daughter and the next day the rash had diminished significantly and totally disappeared within a couple of days . There is nothing improved about them.

However, this couldn't have been farther from the truth. He woke up around 1 am one night and was soaking wet with urine. Keep in mind he had only been wearing the above advertised Huggies diaper for 4 hours at this point. I thought maybe it was a fluke and so I gave the diapers a second chance and this time he wet through them in 3 hours during the day. So disappointing and misleading.

They are durable - they will last as long as you keep them on while your baby is at the beach - without coming off or the sides coming apart. They stay on well even after your baby goes in the water! It is a little bit of a pain to put on - you have to hold your baby down and press the side against the diaper so that it sticks, but this makes taking the diaper off super easy - you just pull at the sides and it's off! The diaper is also labeled \"front\" and \"back\" to make it easy to put on the right way. Overall, very happy with this swim diaper and it hasn't let us down so far!"

They don't swell up like regular diapers in water, which seems so much more comfortable for my kid. Plus, they're super easy to pull on and off, even when wet, which makes changes at the pool a breeze.\n\nDefinitely a 5-star product and a must-have for any parent planning to hit the water with their little one."

These are some diapers they are not supposed to be absorbable what they are supposed to do is be a place to collect poop if your child has a bowel movement while they are in the pool or anybody of water for that matter. I knew it was going to be important for our trip to Punta Cana. Our son is not potty trained and has random bowel movements at all hours of the day so I didn\u2019t trust that he was going to be able to hold it in or tell us that he had to have a bowel movement while we were out swimming. This came in a pack of 17 which was super helpful since we went to the pool multiple times some days often after his nap. It was supposed to do. I wanted to make sure that this hotel didn\u2019t have an incident of hand foot and mouth disease as many of the hotels did and we didn\u2019t wanna contribute to that problem. This product is great it has adjustable straps on the side that run the full length of the diaper so if you need to make it a little bit bigger or a little bit smaller it adjusts. We bought a size 5/ 6 since our son is in between sizes.They were not super expensive and for the price they did exactly we were supposed to do. We went to the pool and ocean with confidence."

I prefer this diaper over the competitor because of the easy open sides. These sides allow you to remove a dirty diaper very easily from a wiggly wet child as opposed to the tear off sides. These diapers do not swell in water. I like to layer this diaper for a reusable diaper for extra protection. I have found that the diapers are able to be used more than once if not dirty, just take off child and dry in the sun and they are ready to be used for your next swim."

I was initially unaware of this and made the mistake of having my 2-year-old wear one to lunch before hitting the pool. It turns out, these diapers aren't designed for holding pee, so that was my oversight in not understanding their proper use.\nHowever, one positive aspect of swimming diapers like this is their durability. They don't disintegrate after prolonged exposure to water. My child found them comfortable, and there were no marks left behind after use, nor did she complain of any discomfort."

So we decided we'd try Huggies again, when our son started his swimming career at age 2. After reading several reviews we decided to order the large size, since people said these run small. Yes, it's true. Our son is just 25 lbs/12 kg, and not chubby, but the large size fits him well and still has some room for growing.\n\nOur first impression was pretty good. Easy to put on, our boy likes the colorful characters (especially Nemo), and they keep the pee inside the diaper well. After swimming it was not very easy to remove the wet and kind of heavy diaper, but we could manage somehow.\n\nThe bad part started when our son finally pooped in these. The poop stayed inside -- that was no problem. But when we tried to remove the diaper, especially with him putting up a fight and fussy, we could only get it to come in such a way that the diaper turned inside out on the way down his legs. Poop fell all over everywhere.\n\nNext time he's poopy in these diapers after swimming, we've decided we are going to cut them off with scissors rather than pull them down off his legs.\n\nWe still like these diapers, but make sure to take as much time and care as possible when pulling them off after a number two. If you are getting in a spot where they look to be turning inside out, be sure to nip that in the bud right away."

In that time, we have used Huggies and one other brand.\nI think Huggies fit a bit snugger than the other brand, and also probably tighter than Huggies diapers of the same size. They are tough to pull on, and even tougher to pull off once wet. (I usually just pull them apart at the edges.)\nTo keep them from absorbing pool water, these diapers have essentially no absorbancy. As a result, we've had a number of instances of wet car seats and wet clothes en route to swimming lessons. (We dress before we leave home and make the short drive to the YMCA for lessons. Easier only to use the dressing rooms once, when we are done.) They do hold up okay to bowel movements (as I discovered last week).\nWe will continue to buy swim diapers until our daughter is potty trained (and then again when our younger child goes through lessons) but I wish they weren't so much more expensive than regular diapers."

I'll happily spend it though rather than wash the reusable swim diapers! These run big though. My daughter is 8 months and 15 lbs and the Small is still too big and has to be sort of rolled down and smushed up at the legs to big into her swimsuits. She's been in the water since 5 months and they were very large at that point and needed her swimsuit just to get them staying up. An XS would be a great addition, especially since I think they run large -- I'd think a baby size Small was in the 0-6 month type range, and these size Small are suggested for 16-25 lbs. No real complaints though other than the prints aren't all that cute. I'd rather a cute pattern than the cheesy Disney stuff. Oh and because these aren't meant to absorb water, definitely don't put these on your child until you're ready to get in the pool -- they don't absorb THAT liquid either!"

If I wanted to get my refund sent back to my card it'd take 5-7 business days, otherwise I could get it in 2-3 hours as an Amazon gift card. I got to keep the size 4s they sent, which is cool, but it doesn't really help me out since they don't fit my son, so I'll just save them and hope we'll get a chance to use them when my son is big enough."

If your child poops that will stay in the diaper but water will get in making a mess and when getting out of the pool you will be able to see brown water running down your kids legs. I however still recommend using them because it will save you from clean clumps of poop out of the pool if they do end up going while in the pool just don't expect it not to be 100% leak proof as they aren't."

However, we just used these last weekend and ended up with two huge messes!\n\nWith the first mess, we were on our way to an amusement park ten minutes away from our home. By the time we got there one of my sons was completely soaked, as was his car seat (and we had just put the swim diaper on before leaving the house). We had no other swim suit with us so I had to wash out the one he was wearing and put it back on him.\n\nThe second mishap occurred when we had just gotten home and were walking into our house. My other son was crying because he had \"wee-wee\" running all down both of his legs. This has NEVER happened with other swim diapers or regular diapers and, again, it seemed that the diaper held none of it.\n\nI cannot believe these are even being sold. What is keeping kids' bodily fluids out of the pools when they're wearing these things??? I am very upset about the experiences we've had and couldn't be more displeased with this product.\n\nIn my strong opinion it should be pulled from the shelves until they can work out these issues."

But after today's experience, I feel like I have to warn parents who are going to put their children in swim class while still in diapers. I have my daughter in a 12 month program at the YMCA. I change her at home before we leave, both bathing suit and swim diaper, so that if we are running late, I am just taking her exterior layer off and we are good. The drive to the YMCA is about 15min. She peed twice, once when we got to there and then again right before the class started. The diapers don't absorb. I would be curious to know what the fluid oz for these are. She is 22 lbs (just had her 12 month check up) and she is in a M size. I can't imagine that these would hold poop if she did happen to poop. Overall, I don't recommend these but not sure if there are any other options out there that actually work. I don't want to experience poop in these, that's for sure. Maybe that's why babies should just swim in the ocean?"

And he sat on quite a few things. That was a fun cleanup! I thought well maybe there was just too much of it and really couldn't believe it was the diaper's fault. The second time was pee and I had just put him in it, picked him up, he peed and it just ran through it onto me. I've been peed on a lot with 2 kids (hey it's better than puke) but I thought I was safe with a diaper between us. I have no idea if all brands are like this but now I'm worried to use any swim diaper in a pool with other kids. I don't think they'd appreciate it."

Even a brand that is higher-end who doesn\u2019t even sell their product in retail stores. I\u2019ve paid just about every price point too, so trust me when I say that I know the difference between a high quality, effective diaper versus a cheap, poorly designed one.\n\nI decided to give this Huggie diaper a go and I\u2019m so glad that I did! First, it is so unbelievably soft. A lot of times, I\u2019d put other diapers on my babies and they\u2019d feel stiff, coarse and just ultimately uncomfortable. They couldn\u2019t be comfortable and yes, they get changed frequently, but my sweet babies live in them, so wouldn\u2019t I want their diaper to be as comfortable as possible?! Of course I do, so these are just about perfect. They are snug, but not overly snug. I\u2019ll be honest, I do not like Huggies Snug and Dry diapers, as they were too tight on both of my babies in the inner thigh area. One of my babies was long and lean and they were still too tight on her, so if you\u2019re baby is a little more chunky like my second, I would say don\u2019t get the Snug and Dry. Get these instead.\n\nSecond, this design really is effective in preventing blowouts and leaks. The diaper pad is very absorbent, but it\u2019s the double-lined barrier around the legs that prevents the leaks the most. This doubled-up barrier is still of course soft on delicate skin. The biggest star of this diaper is the little pocket they\u2019ve put on the back of the diaper right where those blowouts love to find their exit point and make their way up your baby\u2019s back. I cannot tell you how many times this little pocket has caught what would\u2019ve been a mess all over the back of my baby\u2019s outfit or bouncer seat.\n\nAs far as price point goes, these are a little more expensive, but well worth it in my opinion. You really are getting your money\u2019s worth on these diapers. Give them a try! But be warned: you\u2019ll get hooked and your baby will love them!"

My youngest broke out in a horrible diaper rash at such a young age. He has been proscribed strong butt cream to help him through horrible episodes. One point he almost had to be hospitalized. We tried the Pampers then Huggies. I read online Snugglers were great for young babies with sensitive skin and it worked until Snugglers were not an option for older babies. The next option was Movers. We tried those but the horrible diaper rash days were back. After buying tubes of diaper rash cream and not being able to see my baby in pain any longer I found these as a suggestion on Amazon. The reviews were great! And at this point I was so desperate for my son to find comfort.. We have used these for almost a month now and they\u2019re such a life changer! We hardly ever have to use diaper cram any more! My son has not cried once since being in these diapers! It\u2019s truly a miracle! The only down fall is the diaper is not as absorbent as the other Huggies brands, I think that\u2019s due to its soft material. Sometimes if my son needs to pee a lot, his pants might become wet. It doesn\u2019t happen often and I\u2019d take that over a horrible diaper rash any day!"

All the Huggies absorb very well, and prevent blowouts the best for my little one. However, I prefer the Skin Essentials for a couple reasons.\n\n1. They are so soft!\n2. I don\u2019t love the double grip strips on the snugglers and movers. If your child is wiggly, it\u2019s hard to get the diaper on without the purple part rubbing them (it\u2019s very irritating if it rubs on the babies skin). Not a complete deal breaker, but something to consider if your child moves around during diaper changes.\n3. I prefer these minimalist design on these. Again, not a deal breaker, just a personal preference.\n4. They have never irritated my son\u2019s skin who has eczema.\n\nOne thing to note, I don\u2019t think they are the best for overnight absorption if your child is a heavy wetter. I do prefer the Huggies overnights for night time.\n\nI did compare the absorption of these versus the little movers and snug and dry. I poured 8 ounces of water and waited 30 seconds to test the absorption. All absorbed very well!"

Anyway my daughter started getting these little bumps all over her diaper area that would appear and disappear and I had no idea what it was so I decided to try these and the rash she had was almost gone after less than 24 hours. And 48.hours after them arriving the bumps are completely gone. I immediately ordered a big box. Another fantastic thing is the top liner in the diaper that touches the baby's skin is so perfect bc it does not stick to the baby when it's wet. Her old diapers would give her a wedgie of that top layer and it would keep her skin wet and cause rashes I hated it. I won't go back to any other diaper! I just wish Huggies would change the wipes. Take one and wipe your face with it. It's so rough! It's almost painful. I never knew until I used one to take my makeup off. I'm currently using hello bello unscented wipes. One side of them has these little bumps on them and I love that."

The name \u201cessentials\u201d makes it feel like the quality would be compromised but it\u2019s the complete opposite. Diapers are extremely soft, softer than SD. Print is minimal & does great with pictures or light colored clothing, especially for newborn photoshoots. Very absorbent and incredibly soft around the leg cuffs. Inside material is also very soft (especially for my little guy who has very sensitive skin). My son stays dry and I also don\u2019t have to worry about leaking or diaper feeling moist to the touch on the outside.\nThese diapers are just like toilet paper; you get what you pay for. As a mom who\u2019s tried every single brand out there, Skin Essentials is worth every penny and never switching to anything else!"

These huggies are the softest and most pleasant in the entire line of diapers; they absorb well, do not rub, and do not leave behind granules on the baby\u2019s skin. in general, the haggis brand itself is the best, very good absorbency, but the diapers from other lines are hard, the elastic cuts into the baby\u2019s skin very strongly and leaves granules on the baby\u2019s skin. This series of diapers is definitely better and of higher quality. I finally found something that I will order again"

I typically go between little movers and special delivery, special delivery being my favorite. Apparently these are the replacement for special delivery which is such a bummer. They feel very thin, and have that slippery feeling that less expensive diapers (think Walmart brand) usually have. I don\u2019t find that they are as absorbent as snugglers, movers, or special delivery. Most importantly, they fall down so easily. As soon as the diaper gets even a little wet, the diaper is pulling at the tabs and slipping down both my toddler and baby\u2019s bums. Considering these are the most expensive huggies diapers now, that\u2019s pretty unacceptable. Also, although not important, the print is so lame. To go from a cute, colorful, 101 Dalmatians on the special delivery diapers, to a boring barely there micky ear is no fun. I will absolutely not buy these again. Stick to the regular huggies."

They hold barely any pee and each time my baby has pooped, every single time it has leaked out through the legs, been a blowout, or just leaked straight through the diaper. Not being dramatic at all unfortunately :( I think they\u2019re good for when your baby specifically has diaper rash and you\u2019re on top of diaper changes like almost immediately after they pee. Like, seriously not kidding if my baby poops and then pees after, it leaks from somewhere. To be fair, they\u2019re really really soft and easy on the skin compared to a lot of diapers but not convenient at all. (Also yes she\u2019s wearing the right size I checked lol)"

They can both wear size 3 which is convenient for me. When my youngest was in the other sizes, it was more of a pain because the various sizes are very difficult to tell apart of they ever get mixed together like in a diaper bag. The only noticeable difference would be the number on the front but they look identical otherwise. I do wish they would use something more visually different for the sizes like different colors or patterns. Other than that, I have no complaints. My kids generally seem very comfortable in them and it literally takes the worst blowout you've ever seen in your life to even leak a little, where other diapers I have tried would leak from the smallest normal amount of baby's #2."

My little fish loves the water, and I love that these diapers don\u2019t swell up like balloons the second we step into the pool. The stretchy sides? Genius. I mean, who knew baby rolls could get cuter?\n\nChanging them mid-swim is a breeze too\u2014just tear away those sides and boom, done! No wrestling a slippery toddler while they look like they\u2019re auditioning for a dolphin show. And the leak guards? Let's just say they\u2019ve saved me from some seriously embarrassing \"code brown\" situations. Plus, that back label helps me avoid the classic \"is this on backwards?\" diaper struggle.\n\nIf only everything about parenting was this easy!"

I finally found these xs ones and they fit perfect. She was 10 pounds the first time we took her swimming and these were great, and lasted the rest of the summer without getting too small. I loved that they had Velcro tabs because I remember the ones my nieces and nephews wore years ago only being available in pull on which isn\u2019t ideal for a newborn. Bonus points for the finding nemo print which was perfect for our Disney loving family."

I love that the XS go on like a real diaper and not like pull-ups. They work great under swimsuits. I\u2019ll be ordering more as we live in central Florida, have a gas heated pool and almost never lose our swim season."

My son is very small and these are still very tight around the sides and it made me nervous when he went in the pool because I thought he would bust out of it. They held up very well with no accidents which was perfect, but it makes me wonder if I should have sized up? I would say if you\u2019re on the fence about size, even if your baby fits in the size range, but hey maybe he\u2019s a little chunkier babes, just size up for peace of mind."

They don\u2019t dry out and the cap stays on and snaps closed better than other brands. No rashes or reactions either."

Because I have more sensitive skin, I tend to defer to baby wipes as they're made to be more effective yet gentle.\n\nI bought this box of Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes. They are hypoallergenic, though I did buy the scented ones. Unscented is an available option. This is a box with six individual packages with each package having 48 wipes. I absolutely love the cap for these packages as it offers a great way to seal the package and keep the wipes fresh. It makes it a lot easier to justify buying these in bulk.\n\nThese have a nice thickness to them, though they are not overly thick. They are soft, only slightly scented, and do a really nice job of dealing with clean-up needs. I'm just super pleased with them and find them to be very effective. They also don't agitate my skin at all.\n\nThese wipes are not considered flushable. The packages I received also have Disney designs on them that are quite adorable.\n\nI'm not always picky about baby wipes, however, after using these it's hard to imagine using others. These are just different - they feel better, work better, and keep the skin cleaner. These are a great option for baby wipes."

These even absorb the urine smell so much better and clean poo in much less wipes than the other ones that are more expensive. These are definitely the way to go!

As a parent, finding products that are both effective and safe for my baby is always a top priority, and these wipes check all the boxes.\n\nFirst and foremost, the hypoallergenic formula provides peace of mind. I love knowing that I\u2019m using wipes that are gentle on my baby's sensitive skin. We\u2019ve experienced no rashes or irritation since we started using these, which is a significant relief!\n\nThe refreshing scent is another advantage. Unlike some baby wipes that can have overpowering fragrances, Huggies got it just right. The subtle scent leaves my baby feeling clean and fresh without being overwhelming.\n\nEach pack features a convenient flip-top design, making it easy to access wipes with one hand\u2014an absolute must for any busy parent. With 168 wipes in total, I appreciate the quantity provided, offering great value. The wipes themselves are thick and durable, which means they\u2019re perfect for tackling everything from diaper changes to messy hands and faces.\n\nOverall, Huggies Natural Care Refreshing Baby Wipes have exceeded my expectations. They blend quality, convenience, and safety perfectly. I highly recommend them to any parent looking for reliable and effective baby wipes. Thank you, Huggies, for creating such a fantastic product!"

However, you can order larger quantities [ that's more packs] with Huggies. So, one may want to look around and do additional comparison shopping before one commits to a retailer."

Numerous brands have been tried, yet we always come back to Huggies for their quality and value.\n\nFor the past 1-2 years we have been loyal to the Huggies Natural Care wipes because they are soft, strong, unscented, easy to pull from the package, and a good value. I recently came across these Huggies Refreshing Clean wipes and they were a tad bit cheaper so I thought we'd give them a try, knowing that Huggies hasn't disappointed us yet.\n\nThese wipes are exactly the same as the Huggies Natural Care wipes except for the mild scent. They come in the same package, same size and thickness, with the same design on the wipe. The scent is pleasant and clean, not the unpleasant baby powder smell that other wipes have. They are also one cent cheaper per wipe, which adds up if you go through as many wipes as we do. This is a high quality and affordable wipe!\n\nUpdate 03/22/2020: Huggies were all sold out during the corona virus hoarding of 2020 and we had to purchase some Pampers wipes by default. Huggies are a superior overall product than Pampers. The wipes are comparable, but the packaging is so much better with Huggies which is why we purchase the individual packs. Huggies has a filp top and Pampers has a resealable flap. Huggies has a much larger hole to pull the wipes from. Huggies wipes also come out individually while Pampers come out in a long line."

I have tried other wipes and found the bamboo to be so thick and it has a yucky texture and others are so thick too that they feel like they would take forever to decompose. I love that these feel kind of like a strong, soft paper and it makes me feel good knowing they may break down faster. All the types that don't feel like paper leave me with a not so nice feeling. When I wipe baby's bum it feels like they get more off rather than those super thick wipes that are so wet and slippery that they can't catch anything, if you know what I mean. Yes, the paper feel actually helps get the poop off rather than the thicker slippery feel. I hope they keep making these the same texture HOWEVER, I really hope they make a more organic version SOON! Because I keep trying others for a more organic conscious buy."

I usually buy the cheaper kind when I shop just because we don't use them on babies. We use them when we go to the restroom to feel \"cleaner\". So this brand is an upgrade to what I always purchase. The only thing I don't like is if you wipe these on a surface like a countertop that's dark, you can see that they leave behind quite a bit of tiny white fibers. That means when you use it on your skin it does the same thing. The off-brand or store brand I normally purchase does not do that. The smell to me is also kind of like chemicals. I have been opting to buy more cosmetic or beauty items that contain less chemicals and essential oils instead, and I'm getting used to more natural products. The only reason I did purchase these was b/c of the Coronavirus and I have tried not going to the supermarket or grocery stores at all if I can help it. I probably won't be buying these again."

The new closure lid is a bit bulky compared to the last, and as a result I have found that they don't stack on top of one another as easily as the old package design had.\n\nAlso, I noticed that about a month or two prior to this new packaging design, that Huggies has started using a different type of fabric for their wet wipes. This new fabric is much, much more coarse feeling, and has a rather rough feel to it when compared to the extremely soft and gentle fabric from before this new change. This new fabric texture could almost be called a \"wet / soggy fine grit sandpaper\". Granted, it's not quite that rough, but it certainly is nowhere near as soft and gentle feeling as it was just a couple of months back.\n\nIt is so rough feeling in fact, that I am absolutely experimenting with other brands."

The top of the box was taped shut, so my best guess is that it probably broke open (either at the warehouse or UPS transport) and only 8 made it back into the box. I contacted Amazon and since this is a non-returnable item, they gave me the option to refund or replace. I chose replace since I needed the wipes that I ordered.

Baby also had no issues with it.\n\nUntil the most recent shipment -- I noticed something was different right away. The wipes now has a slight texture to it, almost like bounty, didn't feel as soft, looked thinner, and seemed to be drying out quicker. I still didn't think much of it until my toddler started getting rashes. He would also wince and pull back as if they were uncomfortable. The final straw for me was when I decided to use it as a makeup remover wipe (something I occasionally did with these before) and it felt like it was literally scratching/burning my face! I feel terrible for having subjected my toddler to these and will NOT be ordering more. I hate when companies take a well-rated product and start cutting corners at the expense of their customers.

Turns out Huggies did another rebranding of the SAME exact wipes. They\u2019ve now changed the name to Huggies Natural Care wipes. That would be fine if you still got the same amount of wipes for the same price. Well the price hasn\u2019t changed and you now get only 48 wipes per soft pack instead of 56. Shady a** business practice. I know a lot of other parents who love these wipes. I\u2019m really disappointed in Huggies for this. If you\u2019re going to lower the number of wipes you should adjust the price to reflect that!"
