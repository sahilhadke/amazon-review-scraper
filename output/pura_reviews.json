THESE ARE THE BEST. They are silky soft, durable, and one diaper lasts all night. No blow outs during the day, the back of the diaper is long enough so no back blow outs either!! Ny only complaint is that I wish I found them sooner. The wipes are just as great as the diapers and they don\u2019t break the bank! They are affordable. I\u2019m honestly shocked they aren\u2019t selling them at a higher price. I never write reviews but I had to with these. If you are a Mama looking for the best diapers for your babe, look no further. Buy these, you won\u2019t regret it. I promise!!!"

They don't have a gross smell to them like others we have used in the past. My twins also have very sensitive skin so we have changed diaper brands a few times already. So far these have helped their skin heal and there's no blue wetness which is difficult to find without spending a ton of money on them. These are alittle more than other name brands but well worth it without breaking the bank."

(If you are able to afford a composting service I do think it\u2019s worth it and I would recommend dyper or naty). I\u2019m now loyal to these Pura diapers. They are soft, not bulky, and the fit is good. They are simple and work great. I tried the newer sensitive skin Huggies and thought they were overkill on the elastic, frills and poofiness, though maybe they would be good for a heavy wetter. I tried hello bello and they were ok but felt much more plastic-y and stiff. Pampers just not a fan and Bambo nature were ok but quite thin and narrow. Although these Puras are ultimately going to landfill, I like that they are nontoxic and have paper packed . Great buy for a more eco friendly option."

I\u2019ve used them on both kiddos now, and won\u2019t go back to any other disposable. They are the softest, and so absorbent. I was skeptical, based off of some other reviews about absorbency, but these are fantastic. They\u2019re not bulky at all, pretty thin, actually, but they hold up so well. The only thing that I feel could be better in the size 2 is the weight rating, I purchased the size 2 instead of the size 1 because the weight estimates were so close. The size 2 says 7-13lbs. My second baby came out at 8lbs 3oz, 20in tall, and I had to wait until he was around 10lbs before these started fitting properly on him. The first one I ever put on him was right when he was born, and it swallowed him up. He\u2019s over 13lbs now, and they fit well room to grow! I also wish that the larger sizes came with a wetness indicator, but that is not a dealbreaker. My older child has used size 5 and size 6 now, and that is my only critique. I love that they are TCF, and I hope they remain TCF. They don\u2019t carry a scent, which I love. They are also SO affordable. I\u2019ll be using these on all of my kids."

Super absorbent, rarely ever soaks through\u2014it\u2019s only happened during night after drinking way too much fluid beforehand. And the fit is perfect. My LO is tall and narrow and these fit perfectly no gaps.\n\nDon\u2019t let the thinness fool you; these nappies can hold A LOT! and they contain the smell pretty well. At first I was skeptical because they looked so thin; I\u2019d been using Terra nappies previously which are thick and bulky, but these worked even better than Terra nappies and are just as soft. I can pack more Pura nappies in my carryon than I can with other brands.\n\nI\u2019ve tried a lot of different eco friendly/sustainable brands: honest, bambo, seventh generation, and terra. They were all good but not great\u2014these on the other hand are FABULOUS!"

Size 1 and 2 have the yellow line that turns blue so you know when the diaper needs a change. Once we sized up to Size 3, we noticed the line is gone. They don\u2019t have a stretch at the waiste line like other brands, but we haven\u2019t found that to be a huge problem with blowouts or a game changer. These are the only diapers we buy now.

I was on the Coterie train from before I ever tested other diapers because I had heard such great things. I have since tried pampers, honest, dyper, coterie, and pura. Coterie was definitely the best out of the first four, but Pura has by and large surpassed! They are just as clean/nontoxic as Coterie, they are as soft as Coterie, but they are even more absorbent, and thinner! The Coteries got bulky, especially once there was pee involved. I was hesitant on the thinness of Pura's, feeling like they couldn't possibly be as good, but they have lasted better over night (12 hours) than the Coteries ever did and aren't as bulky underneath clothes. I had leaks from Coterie several nights in a row until I finally used the Pura overnight and now it's been a week with no leaks. I'm telling you, from a mom who drove herself nuts to have the best, Pura is the best! And like 30-40% cheaper than Coterie thankfully! Couldn't recommend them more, just bought the bulk package cause I am committed!"

Of all these brands, this brand Pura is the most absorbent I have ever used. I used them for the first time with this purchase and they did not leak one time overnight, as nearly every other brand has. I only purchased them because I needed diapers delivered next day and these did so it was totally by chance I used them but I will almost solely rely on them because of how well they worked for overnight use on my children. (I have three under 3, two in diapers full time, one in diapers at night only). These truly were a game changer for night time, held up all night with no leaks. They are soft, comfortable and honestly well worth the money and I definitely am one to try and get the best deal on anything as a parent. Beyond pleased, highly recommend, new favorite diapers for my kids."

These do not have the line that shows when it's wet quite frankly I don't care or need it you can tell when it's wet the cotton will swell and it's obvious. They hold big blow outs better than those name brands, my daughter 6 months old now is sleeping 6 plus hrs because they hold so well at night and keep her dry. They also havnt not given her rashes I am sure uts because they are cotton. I LOVE these diapers and affordable to my for the fact that they are so much safer than those big brands.

I did not like the Dyper or Andy Pandy- the performance and fit was not as good, and they leaked more easily. The Pura diapers, at first glace, are thinner and have channels which I thought would not hold much. I was wrong. The channels work beautifully- the way the diaper is designed, they are very absorbent, keep baby quite dry, and we haven't had any problems with blowouts. I also really like the clean ingredients and that they are made in Europe. These diapers are definitely a win and are now my go to."

They do run a bit small so I would recommend buying a small pack and making sure the size is right. The diaper is a bit wider than a normal diaper so don't be a knucklehead make sure you apply and fasten it correctly. They are extremely absorbent so if leaks are happening, hate to say it but, user error. These diapers are honestly perfect. Not to be confused with honest brand diapers.

These Pura diapers are far more absorbent than you'd expect upon visual inspection. Those lines that look like they've got no filler in them fill up when the filler absorbs pee. I suppose this extra space prevents the diaper from bursting when too full. These feel quite soft and pliable, no rough or stiff parts.\n\nI took a star off not because of the diapers but to point out the inordinately bad shipping logistics of Amazon. I've ordered 3 boxes total so far, only size 1. Of those 3, 1 came in the wrong size, 1 came 1 day late and the next is predicted to come 4 days late. Those second two were part of a subscription and so you'd expect them to be on time with the rest of your subscription items.\n\nSo....great diaper, order at least a week ahead of time."

So we went to size 2s only to find out they are basically the exact same size but only about an inch higher in rise when fully stretched. The pictures show how width doesn\u2019t change on front or back which is needed for growing waists. So if you max out size 1s, jump straight to size 3s. Hoping I can return this giant box of 2s as they won\u2019t fit."

They\u2019ve worked well enough, no irritation and I love how natural and nontoxic they are. However, I recently came across a clearance box of Honest diapers and decided to give them a try. Holy moly are they absorbent! Our baby is exclusively breastfed and still has fairly watery stools. With the Pura diapers the liquid poo just sits on top of the diaper and it\u2019s a pretty messy ordeal to change her. We\u2019ve had a handful of blowouts and now I understand why. With the Honest diapers they absorb EVERYTHING (even BF stool), leaving nothing to leak outside the diaper. I\u2019m going to use up the rest of my Pura and make the switch to Honest. Both brands run small, size comparison shows both size 3\u2019s to be the same for both brands (although slightly more waist room in the Honest) but the weight range is much less for Pura. I\u2019m not mad we tried this brand and I was happy with them until I realized things could be so much better than they were, so don\u2019t hesitate to give them a try. If your baby has solid stools I think these would work great. We\u2019ve also never had a pee soaked diaper leak so they are great for that too!"

I like the option of a relatively \u201cclean\u201d total chlorine free diaper at a reasonable price.\nBut the size 1 (newborn size) was huge on my 7lb 6oz baby, the velcro tabs overlapped quite a bit. I can\u2019t imagine what it would look like on a 4lb baby as that\u2019s the size it\u2019s advertised for. My baby is currently 10lbs and still wearing the size 1, velcro tabs still overlap a little, but we\u2019re having more leaks so I purchased the size 2. Don\u2019t even bother buying the size 2, there is virtually no difference between the sizes. Maybe 1/8\u201d in length.\nPic 1 is size 1 and 2 next to each other, pic 2 is size 1 on top of size two, you can barely see the diaper under it. And pic 3 is comparing size 1 Pura to a size 1 Pamper diaper. I wish I had a newborn pamper to compare, as it\u2019s a lot smaller than the Pura.\nOverall, I\u2019d still recommend these. But just be aware they may not fit right away, and probably don\u2019t stock up too much on various sizes."

I used to use all types of diapers with my 1st and decided that pampers pure was my favorite, until I tried Coterie with my 2nd baby. Coterie was by far the best when it comes to fit, softness, and absorbency. These diapers (Pura) are my absolute favorite because they are clean, made without any chlorine and all the chemicals which exist in most American diapers. The only problem I have with these is that they don\u2019t have the best fit which caused some leaks. My son wears size 3 and as the sizes increased I noticed more leaks because of the fit. Otherwise, if these diapers had elastics and a better fit they would be the most superior. Not once, even after a 10+ hour sleep, have they been wet when I opened to change my baby! He always stays super dry in these and if it wasn\u2019t for the fit they would be better than Coterie. Unfortunately I have to go back to Coterie because the diapers moves a lot as my baby grows. The price is also perfect, costs less than most big brand diapers while outperforming. I wish they work on it and make it more snuggly, because I can\u2019t wait to switch these with my coterie diapers."

My daughter sleeps with a sleep sack on and one morning the diaper was by her feet and she was soaked and another time one of the straps came off and she was a little wet by the time I checked her diaper in the morning. The straps also do not have grip all the way to tip where you pull it its missing the grip part not sure why.

Price and availability is great compared to some other TCF brands. The tabs stick very strong so repositioning them can be a pain and end up tearing up the diaper a little bit. Diapers tend to slip down a little on my baby with movement and these are no exception. Will probably buy again next time because of price and ease of access!"

My only compliant is the sizing. I ordered A size 1 thinking it would be an actual size 1 diaper. But their size 1 is actually considered to be newborn size 4-11 pounds. Which, if you're a mom you know babies don't stay in this size for very long. So definitely pay attention to the weight restrictions over the actual sizing of the diaper.

So far she hasn\u2019t gotten any rash, so hoping that stays the same.\n\nThe newborn size is also extremely large. Our baby was born at 7lb 2oz.

My son wears a size 4 which is what I ordered in pura diapers but maybe he needed a size 5 and maybe that\u2019s why we had 4 different instances where he soaked through the pura diapers at night.

I still put them on my 3 week old (~6lbs) and they're a bit big.\n\nPros: super soft, non irritable, belly button cutout.\n\nCons: newborn size too big for an actual newborn...let alone a 4lb baby. Leak proof sides aren't too effective especially for that newborn yellow runny stool. My baby had a bowl movement and it almost went through the sides. Doesn't absorb too well.\n\nI will probably not try this brand again until my baby is older and bowl movements are solid."

Let\u2019s start off with the design is so cute. It\u2019s perfect for fall season it has orange different shaped leaves, earth hearts, and laughing baby faces on it. Now you not gonna buy the diaper based off the pattern, but it\u2019s a cute detail. Personally, I don\u2019t think I would repurchase this brand. I\u2019ve dealt with leakage quite a few times and the diaper wasn\u2019t even that full. I didn\u2019t notice this problem in the first pack I got, so maybe I just got a defective batch. It also is her right size and not too big or small, so it speaks to the absorbency level of the diaper. Anyways, in my opinion it\u2019s a hit or miss, I will probably be going for my trusted Abby & Finn clean brand as my next restock (although definitely not as cheap). Hope this helps"

So my boy did not get a rash anywhere with these, except on his sides, where the strap with the pull tab goes across him. Both his sides have had raised redness matching the diaper strap everytime I change him. Sorry Pura, but I'm positive you still have some harmful ingredients in your diapers based on what I'm seeing and smelling. Moving on..."

I presumed it was a diaper rash due to teething, BUT I got a small pack of Huggies to see if the rash would go away and it did. I used another pura diaper (I bought 120 \ud83d\ude2d) to see if it would give her a rash again and this time the rash came back even WORSE! It spread to her thighs, and her Lower belly, huge hive like bumps on her lower back :( I am extremely disappointed as my daughter already suffers topical steroid withdrawal and now she has an additional area of just rash & itchiness.

They felt amazing on the outside.\n\nCons: Sadly, once you open the diaper you realize there\u2019s only three *strips* of cotton down the middle. They do puff up once pee has been absorbed, but so much space is waisted. I felt like I was buying half a diaper.\n\nNext, performance: I had to change them way more than my go-to diaper (Dyper). But worst of all, my LO started to fight me about diaper changes and refused to want to wear these diapers. A few days after our trial-run started with these diapers, a rash formed and she was visibly super sore.

Additionally, the diapers kept tearing on our baby's bum, leaving residue of white stuff from the material innards all over her private parts. It's just extremely off putting and it's just not for us. We've reached out to customer service, and they were really great though. They sent a replacement box to us, and assured us that it's an uncommon occurrence, but the replacements still kept ripping and leaking. Super disappointing that it didn't work for us!

I don't know understand what he would be allergic to considering these are sensitive and organic diapers but I can say for how bad huggies are allegedly, they never caused my kids to break out in hives. Very disappointed mama right now. However I will say the softness of these diapers are great tho but could use more elastic as the diaper isn't that tight on the back."

We bought Pura and were so excited to use them. I noticed after about 3 days of my son wearing these that he was getting tiny red bumps on his butt cheeks exactly where the diapers sit. I kept an eye on them. They\u2019ve only gotten worse and some have turned into what looks like little zits. Will be switching brands unfortunately. I will say that I love the softness, the packaging and they didn\u2019t leak at all over night."

Guess we're back to the drawing board. In the meantime hopefully Costco can fill the void Huggies Special Delivery left. Liked them with my first but really sad it's so much harder to get a TCF option that doesn't cost an arm and a leg so settle for something absorbant at least."

THESE ARE THE BEST. They are silky soft, durable, and one diaper lasts all night. No blow outs during the day, the back of the diaper is long enough so no back blow outs either!! Ny only complaint is that I wish I found them sooner. The wipes are just as great as the diapers and they don\u2019t break the bank! They are affordable. I\u2019m honestly shocked they aren\u2019t selling them at a higher price. I never write reviews but I had to with these. If you are a Mama looking for the best diapers for your babe, look no further. Buy these, you won\u2019t regret it. I promise!!!"

I appreciate the fact that they don't contain toxic chemicals and are made out of more natural materials. They absorb great. No leaks or blowouts. True to size of other name brand diapers. They don't have a gross smell to them like others we have used in the past. My twins also have very sensitive skin so we have changed diaper brands a few times already. So far these have helped their skin heal and there's no blue wetness which is difficult to find without spending a ton of money on them. These are alittle more than other name brands but well worth it without breaking the bank."

They are soft, not bulky, and the fit is good. They are simple and work great. I tried the newer sensitive skin Huggies and thought they were overkill on the elastic, frills and poofiness, though maybe they would be good for a heavy wetter. I tried hello bello and they were ok but felt much more plastic-y and stiff. Pampers just not a fan and Bambo nature were ok but quite thin and narrow. Although these Puras are ultimately going to landfill, I like that they are nontoxic and have paper packed . Great buy for a more eco friendly option."

The use of cotton makes me feel great about putting her in these, since my biggest concern about disposables is unsustainability, but I\u2019ve gotten a strong impression from Pura that they\u2019re really trying to offset that while making it as east as possible for parents.\n\nI will continue to buy these for occasional use until she is potty-trained!"

I\u2019ve used them on both kiddos now, and won\u2019t go back to any other disposable. They are the softest, and so absorbent. I was skeptical, based off of some other reviews about absorbency, but these are fantastic. They\u2019re not bulky at all, pretty thin, actually, but they hold up so well. The only thing that I feel could be better in the size 2 is the weight rating, I purchased the size 2 instead of the size 1 because the weight estimates were so close. The size 2 says 7-13lbs. My second baby came out at 8lbs 3oz, 20in tall, and I had to wait until he was around 10lbs before these started fitting properly on him. The first one I ever put on him was right when he was born, and it swallowed him up. He\u2019s over 13lbs now, and they fit well room to grow! I also wish that the larger sizes came with a wetness indicator, but that is not a dealbreaker. My older child has used size 5 and size 6 now, and that is my only critique. I love that they are TCF, and I hope they remain TCF. They don\u2019t carry a scent, which I love. They are also SO affordable. I\u2019ll be using these on all of my kids."

We love how clean in material they are since baby is in diapers 24/7. They hold well to blowouts. When holding them next to a Pampers or Huggies or Honest diaper, the Pura just feel so gentle for their baby skin. Size 1 and 2 have the yellow line that turns blue so you know when the diaper needs a change. Once we sized up to Size 3, we noticed the line is gone. They don\u2019t have a stretch at the waiste line like other brands, but we haven\u2019t found that to be a huge problem with blowouts or a game changer. These are the only diapers we buy now. Price is amazingly competitive."

I was on the Coterie train from before I ever tested other diapers because I had heard such great things. I have since tried pampers, honest, dyper, coterie, and pura. Coterie was definitely the best out of the first four, but Pura has by and large surpassed! They are just as clean/nontoxic as Coterie, they are as soft as Coterie, but they are even more absorbent, and thinner! The Coteries got bulky, especially once there was pee involved. I was hesitant on the thinness of Pura's, feeling like they couldn't possibly be as good, but they have lasted better over night (12 hours) than the Coteries ever did and aren't as bulky underneath clothes. I had leaks from Coterie several nights in a row until I finally used the Pura overnight and now it's been a week with no leaks. I'm telling you, from a mom who drove herself nuts to have the best, Pura is the best! And like 30-40% cheaper than Coterie thankfully! Couldn't recommend them more, just bought the bulk package cause I am committed!"

I used them for the first time with this purchase and they did not leak one time overnight, as nearly every other brand has. I only purchased them because I needed diapers delivered next day and these did so it was totally by chance I used them but I will almost solely rely on them because of how well they worked for overnight use on my children. (I have three under 3, two in diapers full time, one in diapers at night only). These truly were a game changer for night time, held up all night with no leaks. They are soft, comfortable and honestly well worth the money and I definitely am one to try and get the best deal on anything as a parent.

They hold big blow outs better than those name brands, my daughter 6 months old now is sleeping 6 plus hrs because they hold so well at night and keep her dry. They also havnt not given her rashes I am sure uts because they are cotton. I LOVE these diapers and affordable to my for the fact that they are so much safer than those big brands. Try then you won't be disappointed."

Then I saw THESE diapers and decided to try since someone said they liked them better than Kudos and I have to say I like them better too!!\nPros vs Kudos waaaay softer and don\u2019t bunch up in the crotch area like Kudos do which does bother my tot.\n\nCons- more expensive than Kudos, about $30 more a month and no pee indicator which I\u2019m fine with since I found out those aren\u2019t good for baby anyway."

Before these, my preferred diapers were Bambo nature for the clean ingredients and mostly good performance, and Huggies Special Delivery had the best performance with blowouts but I didn't like the ingredients as much. I did not like the Dyper or Andy Pandy- the performance and fit was not as good, and they leaked more easily. The Pura diapers, at first glace, are thinner and have channels which I thought would not hold much. I was wrong. The channels work beautifully- the way the diaper is designed, they are very absorbent, keep baby quite dry, and we haven't had any problems with blowouts. I also really like the clean ingredients and that they are made in Europe. These diapers are definitely a win and are now my go to."

These Pura diapers are far more absorbent than you'd expect upon visual inspection. Those lines that look like they've got no filler in them fill up when the filler absorbs pee. I suppose this extra space prevents the diaper from bursting when too full. These feel quite soft and pliable, no rough or stiff parts.\n\nI took a star off not because of the diapers but to point out the inordinately bad shipping logistics of Amazon. I've ordered 3 boxes total so far, only size 1. Of those 3, 1 came in the wrong size, 1 came 1 day late and the next is predicted to come 4 days late. Those second two were part of a subscription and so you'd expect them to be on time with the rest of your subscription items.\n\nSo....great diaper, order at least a week ahead of time."

Sizing is off though. A size 1 was huge on her at 6lbs 4oz but we were able to roll them to make them fit. I think a 4lb baby would be swimming in them. Then it was time to size up as the 1s were getting too small at almost 3 months old. So we went to size 2s only to find out they are basically the exact same size but only about an inch higher in rise when fully stretched. The pictures show how width doesn\u2019t change on front or back which is needed for growing waists. So if you max out size 1s, jump straight to size 3s. Hoping I can return this giant box of 2s as they won\u2019t fit."

They\u2019ve worked well enough, no irritation and I love how natural and nontoxic they are. However, I recently came across a clearance box of Honest diapers and decided to give them a try. Holy moly are they absorbent! Our baby is exclusively breastfed and still has fairly watery stools. With the Pura diapers the liquid poo just sits on top of the diaper and it\u2019s a pretty messy ordeal to change her. We\u2019ve had a handful of blowouts and now I understand why. With the Honest diapers they absorb EVERYTHING (even BF stool), leaving nothing to leak outside the diaper. I\u2019m going to use up the rest of my Pura and make the switch to Honest. Both brands run small, size comparison shows both size 3\u2019s to be the same for both brands (although slightly more waist room in the Honest) but the weight range is much less for Pura. I\u2019m not mad we tried this brand and I was happy with them until I realized things could be so much better than they were, so don\u2019t hesitate to give them a try. If your baby has solid stools I think these would work great. We\u2019ve also never had a pee soaked diaper leak so they are great for that too!"

I can\u2019t imagine what it would look like on a 4lb baby as that\u2019s the size it\u2019s advertised for. My baby is currently 10lbs and still wearing the size 1, velcro tabs still overlap a little, but we\u2019re having more leaks so I purchased the size 2. Don\u2019t even bother buying the size 2, there is virtually no difference between the sizes. Maybe 1/8\u201d in length.\nPic 1 is size 1 and 2 next to each other, pic 2 is size 1 on top of size two, you can barely see the diaper under it. And pic 3 is comparing size 1 Pura to a size 1 Pamper diaper. I wish I had a newborn pamper to compare, as it\u2019s a lot smaller than the Pura.\nOverall, I\u2019d still recommend these.

I used to use all types of diapers with my 1st and decided that pampers pure was my favorite, until I tried Coterie with my 2nd baby. Coterie was by far the best when it comes to fit, softness, and absorbency. These diapers (Pura) are my absolute favorite because they are clean, made without any chlorine and all the chemicals which exist in most American diapers. The only problem I have with these is that they don\u2019t have the best fit which caused some leaks. My son wears size 3 and as the sizes increased I noticed more leaks because of the fit. Otherwise, if these diapers had elastics and a better fit they would be the most superior. Not once, even after a 10+ hour sleep, have they been wet when I opened to change my baby! He always stays super dry in these and if it wasn\u2019t for the fit they would be better than Coterie. Unfortunately I have to go back to Coterie because the diapers moves a lot as my baby grows. The price is also perfect, costs less than most big brand diapers while outperforming. I wish they work on it and make it more snuggly, because I can\u2019t wait to switch these with my coterie diapers."

Unfortunately I wanted to use them overnight but they came off completely two times and I don't feel like they are strong enough to last the night with a toddler. My daughter sleeps with a sleep sack on and one morning the diaper was by her feet and she was soaked and another time one of the straps came off and she was a little wet by the time I checked her diaper in the morning. The straps also do not have grip all the way to tip where you pull it its missing the grip part not sure why. However, despite my bad experience overnight, I will order a size bigger next time for my toddler and give it another try. I am definitely going to buy these again for my newborn and give them a try just because I love how soft they are (:"

Diapers are fluffy and cute, no leaks or blowouts (though we don't regularly use disposables and use EC part time), and fit well now that baby is at the upper weight range. Price and availability is great compared to some other TCF brands. The tabs stick very strong so repositioning them can be a pain and end up tearing up the diaper a little bit. Diapers tend to slip down a little on my baby with movement and these are no exception. Will probably buy again next time because of price and ease of access!"

My only compliant is the sizing. I ordered A size 1 thinking it would be an actual size 1 diaper. But their size 1 is actually considered to be newborn size 4-11 pounds. Which, if you're a mom you know babies don't stay in this size for very long. So definitely pay attention to the weight restrictions over the actual sizing of the diaper. Because these size 1s were very small. I would size up from what you intended on purchasing but again, pay attention to the weight limits."

I will say that they were great during daytime. They are very soft and didn\u2019t seem to bother my son at all. They held the urine in well but I also do not let my son go longer than 1.5 hours without a diaper change except at night. Maybe I need to size up because I found them to be on the snugger side when compared to pampers swaddlers FYI. My son wears a size 4 which is what I ordered in pura diapers but maybe he needed a size 5 and maybe that\u2019s why we had 4 different instances where he soaked through the pura diapers at night.

They felt amazing on the outside.\n\nCons: Sadly, once you open the diaper you realize there\u2019s only three *strips* of cotton down the middle. They do puff up once pee has been absorbed, but so much space is waisted. I felt like I was buying half a diaper.\n\nNext, performance: I had to change them way more than my go-to diaper (Dyper). But worst of all, my LO started to fight me about diaper changes and refused to want to wear these diapers. A few days after our trial-run started with these diapers, a rash formed and she was visibly super sore. The rash wouldn\u2019t go away until I quit using these diapers.\n\nI was hoping to like these, but we will not be switching from our tried-and-true brand."

After finished Pampers just I used Pura. And after 1-2 day I saw diaper rash on my little girls skin. I am using cream to heal them but nothing worked her skin has redness because of this diaper. It smells chemical still. Also I subscribed it. When the next delivery time came price increased almost 15$ suddenly. I canceled my subscription and also I won't use Pura anymore.

Well I just started using these and noticed a little rash starting on his hips where the flaps are and then today his whole lower back and upper butt area broke out in hives. I don't know understand what he would be allergic to considering these are sensitive and organic diapers but I can say for how bad huggies are allegedly, they never caused my kids to break out in hives. Very disappointed mama right now. However I will say the softness of these diapers are great tho but could use more elastic as the diaper isn't that tight on the back."

But sometimes the diapers are just crap. These run super small. My kid wore two and both times they leaked and poop was coming out of them. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t suck up anything. They caused a rash. The weird pad design inside of them is the cause of not being able to soak anything up. Just overall a horrible diaper. But they think they can charge fancy diaper prices. No thank you. Good luck to those who actually like this diaper"

Guess we're back to the drawing board. In the meantime hopefully Costco can fill the void Huggies Special Delivery left. Liked them with my first but really sad it's so much harder to get a TCF option that doesn't cost an arm and a leg so settle for something absorbant at least."

I\u2019m what they call a \u201ccrunchy\u201d mom and if a baby is wearing a diaper 24/7, I truly believe that they should be in the best quality diaper. They hold an insane amount of urine (has kept my baby sleeping peacefully since he was THREE months old), quality of materials are amazing, thickness is what you would expect.\n\nThey are also, in my opinion, softer than Coterie (the Cadillac brand of diapers), AND they\u2019re cheaper than Coterie. My baby has NEVER had a rash while using these, and they\u2019re TOTALLY chlorine free, and not just elemental chlorine free which I think is a dealbreaker. I just wish they sold these in stores!!"

He loves putting these on himself, I think it was starting to get embarrassing for him to have his parents put a diaper on him each night, still. So these make him feel more independent, they are very protective and don't fall off like diapers tend to do during the night since the little straps can come off and cause a bed wetting accident. I think these are better than diapers in that way and they are also very soft, stretchy, and don't make that awful papery, crunchy sound that regular diapers do. I love that these ones are also fragrance free, bleach free, carbon neutral, made from plant based materials and in recyclable paper packaging."

I really liked using them, but because they are pull ups and don\u2019t have Velcro sides, I think they would be better for kids that aren\u2019t as squirmy or ones that understand how to step into pants. He understands how to step out, but stepping in was sometimes a struggle. Otherwise, I thought they held up well and he didn\u2019t pull on the waistband like he does with diapers. Overall, I think these are a really great option for parents that are looking for a TCF pull up option."

These diapers feel wetter than other brands and don't seem to hold as much liquid. We thought about using them for overnight but they always leaked."

One of the standout features was their soothing effect on my son's diaper rash. The wipes seemed gentle and left his skin feeling soft, which was a relief during those uncomfortable moments.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of downsides that made me hesitant to purchase them again. First, I found the durability of the wipes lacking compared to other brands. They would often tear easily, especially during more thorough cleanups, which was frustrating. Additionally, these wipes are a bit pricey for our budget. While I appreciate their soothing ingredients, the cost isn't justifiable when considering the overall performance and durability.\n\nIn conclusion, although Pura Baby Wipes did a good job with diaper rash care, the combination of their lack of durability and higher price point means we won't be repurchasing them. There are more affordable and durable options available that better suit our needs while still giving our son the comfort he needs."

The wipes themselves feel somewhat dry, they stick together in the package and are hard to unstick with one hand, and are very thin, forcing you to use double what you would normally use. I love what the brand stands for, but execution needs work."

So I find an \"end\" again and pull, and 5 or 6 wipes want to come out at the same time. Uggg. Plus, there is only a piece of tape to re-seal the package, and it loses it's adhesive quickly. Plus, when several wipes tried to come out at once, it ripped the opening. So then I had to place some of my own tape over it so that the rest of the wipes didn't dry out. However, before I could use the entire package, many wipes DID dry out entirely. I'd say that if this company changed the design of their package, it would make the product MUCH more user-friendly."

These wipes domt work well for us. I was originally impressed by the ingredients but that's about where the pros stop. These smelled oddly like yogurt? Like plain yogurt which added a sickening tartness to my baby's skin. There is also no texture so I feel like I have to use more wipes to actually get my baby clean. I went through these really fast so I don't think they are a good value at all. I will not purchase these again. Their diapers are however, phenomenal and comparable to Parasol if you are interested."

Whenever you\u2019re trying to get a wipe out they come out a million at once and then the packaging tears and the closure sticker barely holds. I\u2019m used to wipes sticking together, but somehow, these stick WORSE. When you\u2019re trying to pull them apart they just stretch out and stay stuck. So many times I\u2019ve gotten just a stack of wipes at once, especially after the packaging is torn. I\u2019ve resorted to taking a bunch out, separating, refolding, and putting them back in the pack. They are also so thin, almost threadbare, usually with other wipes, I feel like my hand is \u201cprotected,\u201d but with these I feel like my hand is much more \u201cexposed.\u201d They also don\u2019t smell very good.

They are a lot worse than I remember. They are so thin, I end up having to use triple the amount of wipes and they barely have any moisture, so it is hard to get my toddler\u2019s bottom fully clean. Even my toddler hates them!! He has been crying during diaper changes because the wipes are so dry. I hope Pura improves these wipes! I love Pura diapers, so it\u2019s definitely disappointing.
