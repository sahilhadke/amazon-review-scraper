I was adamant that they needed to be as environmentally friendly as possible while still being comfy and doing their job. Several other brands had a rough feel to them. Dyper brand is so soft, and we've never had a night or nap leak in them. That wasn't true of the other brands we tried. Now that we're potty training (also he's a big boy so his size outgrew the diapers. He's got too much junk in the truck and the diapers were too slim) it just made sense to stick with Dyper training pants. I'm very happy with them. They fit great, are still soft, and don't leak at night. I only wish the charcoal ones came in training pants."

We used the P brand w our first for a while and decided we wanted something more environmentally friendly, so we paid for a composting service. When we got these pull ups for night time, true to brand they are slightly bulkier than plastic name brands but much softer, absorb more, more comfortable (4 yr old opinion) and scent free. We were gifted a pack of brand P that a neighbor had outgrown the other day and I noticed that they were much harder to get on when the kids are wet after bath. They would stick to their legs despite me working to get them dry. This meant we got leaks overnight twice in a month because I didn\u2019t get them sealed around the legs. The has not happened w the Dyper brand, much easier to get on."

                    "review": "I like these training pants / briefs style of diapers. We're actually not using these as potty training pants yet and have just been using it as a normal diaper. I really like these! My little one knows to lift his legs up now when I tell him we're putting pants on, and he did the same for me with these. These diapers are soft and plush. This definitely feels better than some of the other cheap, plastic-y type of diapers. These definitely have a good amount of stuffing, and is way better than some of the drugstore brands I purchased - talk about paper thin on those diapers! I'm not trying to compare these with the \"cheap\" brands, just pointing out the obvious physical difference in the material and stuffing. All that said, the softness does not matter all that much though, as long as the overall quality is good - and these are.\n\nAt first I got these 2T-3T thinking I would save them for when my baby is ready for this size. He is still wearing 12M clothes and I believe we're still using size 4 or 5 diapers! I was surprised when I opened these and they look to be about my son's size. When I put these on him I was surprised that this fits. It does have the stretchy band, so it can stretch quite a bit. I can't say if these run big or small but it seems like most people are saying it runs big, so I am very pleasantly surprised my little one can wear these already. Although these are pretty \"clean\", they do have a bit of a smell to it. I recommend to take these out of the packaging and let it air out for a little bit. Once you let it air out it is fine. We usually take out all the diapers from its packaging and dump it inside a box, regardless of brand. I like to mix and match different ones on a daily basis.\n\nI appreciate the indicator line on these, and that is the one thing about diapers that are non negotiable for me. That's a feature I need to have on my diapers as I often rely on that line. There is a the Dyper giraffe logo on the front, which makes it easier for you to tell which is the front and back. The diapers looks very simple, clean, and straightforward.\n\nThese diapers are advertised as plant based and eco friendly but I didn't see any information about how well these disintegrate in the landfill. I don't know if these do or if they just sit in the landfill for decades. I wish they provided more information from an eco conscious perspective, as that would have been something that would make me support this particular brand of diapers and make these diapers stand out from its competitors.\n\nOverall I would say give these DYPER(s) a try. Diapers seem to be a personal thing that works differently for every baby, this might just be your new favorite. The diapers seem pretty \"clean\" and if that type of thing is important to you, definitely check this brand out.\n\nLast thing I'll add is I would like to urge the company to hi-light the eco aspect of these, as that will be one of the things that will help you stand out from major big name brands. As of now, all I know is these are made from bamboo, but I'm not being convinced as to why I should make the switch to this material over some of the other \"clean\", plant based materials."

She is able to take them off and pull them back up by herself with ease - and they are still nice and snug without leaking. I've read about bamboo vicose before, but this is the first time actually getting something made from this. I was skeptical because my initial, unlearned opinion was that bamboo cannot become something soft?! However these are actually more soft and plush than our usual diapers! It is super absorbent and comfy.\nSIZING\nOur LO was wearing size 4T diapers and I was worried these might be too small. However, when I lay them flat on top of each other, these Dypers are actually about 1/2\" wider and 1\" longer than the 4T diapers. So these are great if you usually use 4T, but may be too big if you normally buy 3T."

My daughter does seem to be motivated by the characters or print ones. But a basic plain white like this is gender neutral and crisp looking. They have the wetness indicator on them. Also most of the printed training pants are pretty obvious for front versus back. These have a subtle mark so I had to show my daughter which was which as she likes to put them on herself. It took some practice. Size wise, I went by weight versus age and actually went up a size so they wouldn\u2019t be too tight or binding. That worked out fine for us.\n\nI appreciate the fact they are made without the chemicals. They have caused no irritation and have been gentle on her skin while being absorbent when needed.\n\nPleased with these overall and I would buy them again."

I know the price on these is really high but I hate seeing her suffer so I am willing to pay what I need to, to ensure she doesn't get a rash. These training pants are great. She never gets a rash with them. They are very soft. She can easily pull them up and down on her own. She still has trouble telling the front from the back but that isn't a big deal.

If you're loyal to their brand, you'll know their stuff usually runs large; this one is no exception. If you care about the perfect fit, get one size smaller, but if oversized diapers don't bother you, then this will be fine. The larger diaper allows it to contain blowouts better and absorb more liquid. These training briefs are perfect on the go and when you start potty training. Best of all, these will leave your baby's butt dry. Like other diapers, there's no front or back indicator for these. At least, they include the blue wet line indicator."

                    "review": "I currently have a 3 year old who isn\u2019t interested in potty training yet. We had a bunch of size 2T and 3T pull ups left over from my first son but those are already too small. He is about 39lbs and wears size 3T and 4T clothing and size 6 in most diapers. I tried the size 6 in this brand for him and they ran too small for him to wear comfortably. I decided to try these as a slightly larger size option. These actually fit him really well and comfortably. Considering these are supposed to be 4T-5T I would say they definitely run on the small side if you compare to other diapers and toddler clothing. The smaller sizes did fit my daughter accurately though. I think my son just has a little more junk in his trunk and around the sides lol.\nThese briefs have almost all the same features of this same brand of diapers that I really love. They are super soft, have the yellow wetness indicator, and when they get liquid in them they stay pretty firm/solid instead of feeling mushy. What\u2019s even better about these is the elastic between the front and back. It\u2019s super soft and stretchy and comfortable for him to wear and feels more secure than just the little strips most diapers have. What really blew me away is the extra elastic/stretchy pieces down around the leg opening too. It really makes for a much more realistic brief type fit and feeling and far superior to the big name brands of pull ups. My son may be a little bummed about no fun characters but he will get over it. I will mention I did notice a slight smell to them when opening though. It\u2019s not a chemical smell per se but its definitely not a fresh/natural smell. It\u2019s very very faint though.\nEven though my son still isn\u2019t quite ready for potty training I may have him start wearing these regularly anyway just because they fit so nicely on him. They are easy to tear down the sides as well in case you do have to clean them up more like a diaper.\nOverall I really like this training pants/briefs and will definitely continue to use this box. If you have the extra money to spend since they are pretty pricey, I would definitely recommend these. Considering usually training pants aren\u2019t worn for near as long, one box might be enough and might just be worth it to have this nice quality."

He's able to pull them up and down by himself. They don't leak. They're actually absorbent enough to use as diapers. The material is soft, and doesn't irritate his skin.\n\nI asked the manufacturer if these were biodegradable. There's no mention of it on the packaging or on Dyper's website, and I received no response to my query. To me, that means that no, they are not biodegradeable. I like that they're made of bamboo and that the manufacturing process has less of an impact on the planet, but hate that they're not biodegradeable. That's the big thing. Diapers take at least 500 years to break down. Five. Hundred. Years. Basically, my child's great great great great grandchildren will be gone before these training pants fully degrade, and that's just a guess. The first disposable diapers are still solidly full of poo in a landfill somewhere, and won't be degraded for another 450 years.\n\nBetter for the planet, but not best for the planet. Though effective, convenient and the best at keeping my carpet / furniture clean, once they're done I'm going to stick with our cloth training pants for a clean consience."

I\u2019m sure they\u2019re much less plastic than other brands, I\u2019d just like more info about this. They are also eligible for the REDYPER program, where you send used ones back to DYPER for a price to be composted. How much of it gets composted since it has plastic materials?

To me, an avid Luvs user, this is pretty high of a price point for something my 3 year old toddler wears only at night to catch any leaks. I do like knowing that the material is very safe and clean for wearing for over 12 hrs., but I'm not sure if I would regularly buy these. The packaging is really nice and these make me feel really good about buying, but at the end of the day, it's an overnight diaper for my use and I'm just being honest in saying that I will go back to the Luvs brand instead when these are gone."

They\u2019re roomy and absorbent, as well. My granddaughter is 2 (3 in July) and usually wears a size 5/6 and the 5/6 were just a tad too roomy - so keep that in mind when ordering, as they seem to run a bit big.\n\nMy only critique would be that they\u2019re not always amazing at keeping everything \u201ccontained\u201d during messier situations, but that's probably because they\u2019re a too big for my granddaughter."

It is nice that these are eco-friendly and uses natural products, However, the price per diaper is steeper than other leading brands which could be due to the natural ingredients.

We got a package of this brand as a gift and my son loves than. The fit great, are great quality, and not so thick he cannot move. With other diapers he was waking up every time he peed at night because he could feel the wetness now he goes 4 hours at night (that's when he wakes up to nurse). We also have never had an issue with rashes in these diapers.\nThey do have issues with blowout in the back of you didn't get to it soon enough but that can be solved by folding the back flap a little. Also they are a bit pricey, but if it means his comfortably and him sleeping I'll cut a coat somewhere else."

I\u2019ve tried several different diapers in an attempt to find the one that works best for us and my baby. Turned out, it was this diaper. I\u2019ve tried both this specific diaper, as well as their charcoal infused diaper - I prefer the plain white diaper.\n\nWe\u2019ve used size 1 and size 2 so far. Neither have allowed for leaks. This diaper holds a lot. Right now my LO is peeing and pooping frequently, so we change him every 1-2 hours during the day, but the diaper would hold for longer if we let it. It\u2019s also been great for overnight when he is in the diaper longer. The absorbency is great. My baby hasn\u2019t had a single diaper rash with this diaper.\n\nThe diaper is your basic diaper design, and plain white. The materials are all listed, and natural, so there won\u2019t be harsh chemicals on my baby\u2019s skin.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely worth the money. Five stars."

We\u2019ve been solely using these diapers for his whole life (6 months) and they are amazing and wonderful and I can\u2019t sing their praises enough. Not to mention- the company is incredible with customer service! The trick here is your baby will size out of these like a thief in the night- don\u2019t know how to else to describe it. It seems to fit fine but it just doesn\u2019t- you have to size up pretty early, earlier than the weight stated per size in my experience. As long as you do this they work like a dream!\n\nI was so excited to use these for my new baby. I try to be as eco-conscious as possible and avoid a lot of the toxic ingredients found in just about every single thing they sell is in America. This brand has made a step in the right direction as far as safety of ingredients and the capability of these diapers to break down naturally! I thought for sure I\u2019d use these the whole time for my baby. HOWEVER\u2026\n\nThese diapers leak everywhere. Any time I put one on my baby he ends up covered in a mess. They do run bigger so I waited a couple weeks for him to even be able to wear the newborn size but even now they do not hold anything in. I\u2019m so sad, I really wanted to love these. The idea is wonderful, as is the softness and I love that they don\u2019t use ink and are plain white- but the functionality is just not there and I can\u2019t possibly use them."

They want you to do it in a commercial facility. We already have a humanure composting system in place, so we are going to see if they break down there. Thirdly, how do disposable users deal with all the blow-outs? I had to call to get some tips from my sister because wtf. I get a blowout in a cloth diaper very very rarely. Anyway fairly good product that helped me out of a jam, lessening the load just a little. Also, cloth diaper as much as possible, please.

The diapers are unprinted, unscented, feel soft, and are durable enough to hold in large amounts of your kid's outputs. The diapers fit snugly, wicks moisture away well, and didn't irritate my nephew's skin. They are on par with other well-known brand-name diapers, and the nephew had no issues with leaks or blow-outs. The only real issue that we had with the diapers is that they do run larger than other diapers. This isn't a huge issue given that diaper sizes vary from baby to baby and because we could use the diapers on my nephew at a later time.\n\nThe thing that makes these diapers unique is that they are made with very eco-friendly materials. The diapers are made of bamboo and are packed in bags made with oxo-degradable materials. There is a service called Redyper where you can send back the used diapers via mail, or via local pick up so that the diapers and their contents can be composted. My niece didn't look up to try this service for her kid, but rested a little easier knowing that the diapers would at least compost down. Overall, as far as diapers go, this is an excellent quality diaper that is safe for your baby's skin and ensures your baby will be dry throughout the night."

The diapers are quite absorbent through long sleeping hours.\n\nThe Good\n\nVery soft on babies skin, the diapers are also pretty absorbent\n\nCons\nThe size maybe a little bigger for smaller baby\u2019s so what is 1 in most diapers brands you may need to get newborn size instead.\nYour going to miss the blue indication line which is on almost all other brans, they will need to eventually do something about that.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe diapers are almost perfect, would work well for baby\u2019s with sensitive skins more than other brans, if your kid has this problem this would be the way to go , you won\u2019t even need diaper rash creams. before purchasing this you will need to check the size to make sure as in my baby\u2019s situation size one was a little bigger than other brands, and finally I think if they start including the blue/yellow line it would literally have this one of the top diapers out there."

For now, we'll just be happy to be putting less plastic and chemicals in the landfill.\n\nThe diapers seem to be a bit on the larger side but they also seem to be designed to cover a bit higher than some other brands. The extra protection is welcome and it is nice to know we have a little more flexibility about when to go to the next size up. They also seem to work fine with the top of the front folded down in a pinch. The fact that they are slightly larger is actually an advantage since they can stay in a smaller size longer which includes more diapers in the pack for the same price. a\n\nOverall very happy with the \"DYPER Bamboo Baby Diapers | Natural Honest Ingredients | Cloth Alternative | Day & Overnight | Plant-Based + Eco-Friendly | Hypoallergenic for Sensitive Newborn Skin | Unscented\"."

They have composting services with pick up and mail in options. I was a little hesitant about how shipping dirty diapers was going to go but it\u2019s been working so well!

The diapers have no pattern or prints on them and have no smell, which is one thing I love about them.

I like that it is unscented even though I do like when diapers have a pleasant baby powder smell (like Pampers), and that there is a wetness indicator. The absorbency is great but I'm not confident about using it as an overnight diaper, especially if you baby is at that age where it starts to sleep for longer stretches without middle of the night diaper changes and breastfeeding. My baby woke up with it's pajamas covered in pee. I felt so bad about that. And this was after a 10 long sleep overnight. But for daytime wear, these worked out fine."

Larger - economical - wide ruffle coverage. Soft and cushy! Perfect for sensitive skin! Packaged in soft bag type containers."

You don\u2019t want to worry about what you\u2019re placing on your baby and this is a brand I feel I can trust. And yes it is true, when I had my newborn twins we HATED these diapers. They leaked everywhere!!! So we gave them up pretty quick. I surrendered and switched to pampers pure since you can imagine the amount of diapers I go through with two babies and need a cheaper reliable option I can always find at Walmart. However, one day when my twins were bigger, Walmart was out of pampers pure so I had to buy the size 1 Dyper brand. And to our surprise, these diapers did not leak!!! No problems whatsoever. These quickly became my favorite diaper because they look so trim and nice and just the simplicity (and of course great ingredients). So maybe find a different diaper you like when you have a newborn so you don\u2019t have a bad taste in your mouth and then give it a go once your baby fits in size 1 and above."

                    "review": "These diapers are soft, yes, but not super soft in a memorable way. They definitely feel better than some of the other cheap, plastic-y type of diapers but I wouldn't say it is the softest diapers I've felt. The inside of the diapers do feel a little softer than the outside. These definitely have a good amount of stuffing, and is way better than some of the drugstore brands I purchased - talk about paper thin! I'm not trying to compare these with the \"cheap\" brands, just pointing out the obvious physical difference in the material and stuffing. All that said, the softness does not matter all that much though, as long as the overall quality is good - and these are.\n\nSizing wise these fit our baby about the same as other popular brands, with no issues about it being too tight or loose. The closure works great and seems comfortable on baby. I appreciate the indicator line on these, and that is the one thing about diapers that are non negotiable for me. That's a feature I need to have on my diapers as I often rely on that line. These diapers have no cute cartoon or graphics on them, which is fine as that is one less chemical to worry about. The diapers just look very simple, clean, and straightforward.\n\nOur little one doesn't have blowouts too often as we're mostly at home and we change him as frequently as needed. We rarely have to change him in the middle of the night or wake up to him soaked in his crib come morning. That said, we did experience 1-2 wet diaper leaks. One was during the day and other was at night, so I will not be using these for night time use anymore. Overall these work well in the day time though, and it isn't anything to where I'd say to avoid these or for me to never use this brand again. He could have just had too much water/milk that day, more than usual, so until I test this out throughout a longer period of time, I won't fully blame the quality of the diapers.\n\nThese diapers are advertised as plant based and eco friendly but I didn't see any information about how well these disintegrate in the landfill. I don't know if these do or if they just sit in the landfill for decades. I wish they provided more information from an eco conscious perspective, as that would have been something that would make me support this particular brand of diapers and make these diapers stand out from its competitors.\n\nOverall I would say give these DYPER(s) a try. Diapers seem to be a personal thing that works differently for every baby, this might just be your new favorite. The diapers seem pretty \"clean\" and if that type of thing is important to you, definitely check this brand out.\n\nLast thing I'll add is I would like to urge the company to hi-light the eco aspect of these, as that will be one of the things that will help you stand out from major big name brands. As of now, all I know is these are made from bamboo, but I'm not being convinced as to why I should make the switch to this material over some of the other \"clean\", plant based materials."

The urine just soaks right through (and this isn\u2019t me allowing him to sit in a diaper for very long either). So, I am sad to say I no longer recommend this brand. Something had to have changed for there to be such a stark difference from my first go-around with these diapers. These are trash now. Literally. I might as well just throw out my opened package because they have no use to me now.\n\nUpdate, 2024: I figured out that it\u2019s just the newborn size that doesn\u2019t seem to absorb the urine the same way the bigger sizes do. My first son never wore the newborn size because he was a rather large baby. I followed the weight recommendations appropriately for my second son, and he wasn\u2019t an abnormally heavy wetter, but he did start in the newborn size unlike my first son. Once I switched to a size 1, however, the problem ceased entirely. I\u2019m updating my rating to a 4 for the quality of the sizes above newborn."

I initially liked our regular brand, Pampers Swaddlers, more because those feel much softer vs these that have a bit more of a paper-like feel on the outside (but they are not at all rough - that is just in comparison). While I still like Pampers, I've come to really like this brand. We've had a couple of heavy diapers and these have kept the messes contained well. The shape of the diaper is what makes them stand out for me. I think they call it a \"yoga\" snug shape or something like that. Now I still can't get myself to embrace the cost. In comparison to what I use now, they are more expensive. I know that these are more sustainable, even the packaging, but when it comes to buying as many diapers as we do, it comes down to the cost. So I definitely keep an eye out if these go on sale or something. But if money is not really an issue, I think these are actually quite nice."

They are comparable in absorbency with other leading brands and conveniently has the wetness indicator. I only had one incident where the diaper was very packed and there was a small leak. The back of the diapers runs tall and provides coverage when poop rises up. I haven\u2019t had back explosion yet. The texture is like paper towel and not as soft as other leading brands in my opinion. I did not notice any scent which is good if baby has sensitive skin. I also want to mention that there are no prints or designs on the diapers- just a plain color. It is a plus that the diapers are eco-friendly. My only gripe was that the packaging was thick and took effort to open it Also, the cost for these diapers seem higher per diaper. Overall decent quality!"

It absorbs a lot of fluid, and we did not have any blowouts after going through about 100 diapers. For containing the mess, these are on par with the more common brands for sure.\n\nThe smell of urine does leak out much more than what we've noticed with Huggies and Kirkland brands... and these Bamboo DYPER's are quite a bit more expensive per unit... so it's hard for me to really recommend these over the competition for most babies, but if your child's skin is very sensitive to normal diapers, then definitely give these a try."

He\u2019s at the very bottom end of the size 4 so the waistband is a bit big but we can make it work.

I went in to check on him after an hour because his chatter with his older brother had turned to hysterical sobs and found his entire crib and self covered in poop. Not liquidy poop that would have leaked out of any diaper- THICK sticky poop that somehow escaped the sides and it seemed like he was trying to make it go away but kept spreading it.\n\nI can\u2019t prove that these diapers cause the problem, but when the very first one we tried caused so much drama and we\u2019ve never had something like that happen before, I don\u2019t want to try them again. Will be using the rest of this pack during his play time and not during his normal poop routine.\n\nAlso, for diapers trying to be all natural and better for baby, I don\u2019t understand why these have a wetness indicator. Those are so toxic. The only reason these have 2 stars instead of 1 is because they are very soft and do feel nice. They seem to absorb plenty of pee as well."

For the new born diapers, there isn\u2019t a cut out for the umbilical cord so you can\u2019t use these until their belly button is fully healed. Even after her cord fell off when I used the diapers it irritated her belly enough to make it bleed. Now that her belly is fully healed the diapers do not conform to her body and they leak. She regularly has blow outs in these diapers and not in hello bello or in huggies. We change her every 2 hours or sooner, and she\u2019s regularly damp because the diapers do not absorb quick enough, they do not hold enough liquid, and they are too stiff and do not conform to her body. I couldn\u2019t even imagine trying these for my 2 yo son who gets changed less often. If you want an environmentally friendly diaper check out hello bello.

Given this strange fit I believe this is the cause of leakage for us. They just didn't hug the body right. Mind you I've had no problems with fit on him with other brands, he's a big boy but not excessively so. The pros are that they are clean diapers, no extra chemicals and products but the cons are the leakage and fit. If they can redesign I think it would benefit the brand."

I purchased these diapers for my son who has sensitive skin, and is very prone to diaper rash from all the harsh chemicals they put in Pampers, Huggies, Luv\u2019s etc. My son was constantly waking up in the night with severe diaper rash, I tried oatmeal baths, diaper rash cream, air drying, prescribed creams and nothing was working. I even went as far as changing his diet to help soothe him. I did some research and found these diapers, I was hesitant at first due to the price point, but desperate to help easy my baby\u2019s pain. After using these, he\u2019s never gotten a rash since! I\u2019m amazed. I highly recommend these diapers to any parent also struggling with diaper rashes with their little ones. These also do not leak which was a huge plus for me. My son drinks a ton of water before bedtime and with any other brand he wakes up completely soaked, clothes soaked and his bedding. But since these he\u2019s dry. These are hypoallergenic, soft, absorbent and 100% bamboo. I love them and will continue using the DYPER brand until he\u2019s potty trained.\n  \n"

They are cleaner than a lot of options out there and fairly affordable. I don\u2019t like that they all stick together so I always pull out a few and it definitely takes multiple wipes and a bit of pushing to wipe away messes.

                    "review": "I was super excited to try these as I currently have 2 kids in diapers and I\u2019ve just recently discovered how soft stuff made out of bamboo is. As far as softness these diapers definitely don\u2019t disappoint. They may be the softest diapers I\u2019ve tried. A couple initial observations I made are that they do have the yellow to blue wetness indicator. One thing they don\u2019t have is any sort of indicator on which size is which. With 2 in diapers this has led to a lot of confusion and my 1 year old ending up wearing way too large of diapers.\nAs far as putting the diapers on, I feel like they seem to have a lot of extra material that hangs down under the butt. It wasn\u2019t as noticeable on my 3 year old in size 6 but was super obvious on my 1 year old in size 4. The 4\u2019s fit my 24lb 1 year old who is just moving up to size 4 pretty well other than that. The 6\u2019s on the other hand don\u2019t fit my 38lb 3 year old very well at all. They\u2019re tall enough but not wide enough. I have to really stretch the side pieces to get them to reach around him and he\u2019s not chubby at all. He still wears size 3T clothes. He normally wears size 6 in Luv\u2019s with no issues. I feel like the 4\u2019s run pretty accurate for sizing but the 6\u2019s definitely run small which is a bummer since its the biggest size. I included a photo of the 6\u2019s (left) next to the 4\u2019s (right) and they\u2019re really not that far different in size, especially in width.\nAs far as performance, these have been great for my one year old. We haven\u2019t had any leaking and we also haven\u2019t had any issues with her super sensitive skin. I really like the absorption ability. When they get full they get firm like a dense gel instead of squishy and saggy like a lot of diapers. That\u2019s probably my favorite thing about them since my husband likes to just toss dirty diapers on the floor while changing and the squishy ones leave little wet prints on the floor. These do not. With my 3 year old and the size 6\u2019s these unfortunately leaked overnight. He normally doesn\u2019t have any issues with the Luv\u2019s, but I think thats mainly just due to the size 6\u2019s running small.\nOverall I really like these and will continue to use them for my 1 year old daughter. Unfortunately my 3 year old has sized out of them, but I\u2019m hopeful to try the training pants in larger sizes once he\u2019s ready to potty train. The 6\u2019s will probably work fine for my daughter if she ever makes it to that size. I will just have to remember to bust them back out before she actually gets to the 6 size. I think I would still recommend these despite the couple flaws because they are soft and environmentally friendly and perform pretty well when they fit properly."

I've seen Dypers being advertised on social marketing and really wanted to give them a try.\n\nFirst impression is that I love that there is no plastic in the packaging. The diapers are wrapped in this substantial/thick paper wrapping. They are fluffy and look very comfortable. The stretchy ridge along the side that holds all the grossness in seems to be more substantial. They have added flaps where the band attaches so they should fit a wide range of babies for a longer period of time - which is great when you have a baby between sizes. I think we left our kid in Newborn size diapers for a week too long. We didn't want to waste the diapers - but It was self-punishment.\n\nMy son doesn't really comment or react differently to the diapers so I assume he's good with either brand. He tends to have blow-outs at least once every other day - if not daily. I will say that the dyper kept one of the blow-outs in all the way, but he got the best of them the second time around.\n\nWith the other brand, we assume we know that we should just start undressing him the second he needs to be changed.\n\nThere are no cute decor to the diapers, they are plain white. I kinda like the cute designs, but whatever, white matches everything.\n\nThe last and most noticeable observation is....the price. These are almost twice as expensive as our other \"responsibly sourced\" brand. I love feeling good about the environment on the manufacturing side, however, these are all ending up in the landfill and I'm not sure if there is data that shows these decompose faster or better than other diapers. Our other brand will be manufacturing in the USA (or just started to...), so maybe they will be similarly priced soon, but for right now - it's hard to make the leap from .26 to .44 per diaper. I feel terrible saying that because I really love supporting earth-friendly \"feel good & put your money where your values are\" companies.\n\nIn summary: These diapers offer an improvement in design - and possibly function. They are recognized for their earth friendly manufacturing and materials. The diapers feel quality, not like they will disintegrate in your hands or on their booties. The only hesitation is the price. If you got the bucks, go for it!\nHope this review helps!"

It absorbs a lot of fluid, and we have not had any blowouts yet. For containing the mess, these are on par with the more common brands for sure.\n\nThe smell of urine does leak out much more than what we've noticed with Huggies and Kirkland brands... and these Bamboo DYPER's are quite a bit more expensive per unit... so it's hard for me to really recommend these over the competition for most babies, but if your child's skin is very sensitive to normal diapers, then definitely give these a try."

Dyper brand diapers are absorbent and we have had no issues at all with them. The do seem to run a little larger than other brands, but only by a smidge. They are adjustable, so it's not a concern at all. This quantity is amazing! We will not need to buy diapers for two of our grandchildren that both are size 4. It saves Mom and Dad from packing them what they need when they are heading here. These are a true alternative to cloth diapers, but you do get the disposable part!\nYes, they are a little more costly per diaper if you are comparing them to \"other\" diapers.

It is extremely pricey for diapers but it is great as it is more eco-friendly than other diapers including the brand named brands. These diapers are light but thick enough to be able to provide flexibility and breathability for baby all the while providing comfort and durability. Nobody likes blow outs and this brand prevents them completely for us. It\u2019s also the only diaper that my son doesn\u2019t have any sort of reaction or itchiness to from the elastic part of the diaper. If your baby is between diapers, It\u2019d be okay, imo, to size down. It does run a tad big for us. Holds a lot as well.\n\n5 stars regarding quality\n4 stars with price. Kids are already so expensive. This one, although worth it, is hard to afford for regular or low class families."

They are no frills (no cartoon patterns or anything), fit well (a smidge big if anything) and we never had a leak. However, we did not continue to use them due to the price. The same is true of this size.\n\nI'd peg them a hair bigger than the name brand Size 1's, but they don't leak and we haven't seen any skin irritation. The lack of a design or print does means sometimes you initially mistake the front for the back when you're getting ready to put them on, but that's not a big deal. Ultimately our only real complaint is that these run about twice the price of the name brand diapers and it's just hard for us to justify that when the name brand ones work pretty well."

They are unprinted, unscented, hypoallergenic, and cruelty-free to protect the next generation. My baby has accidents and these hold up so well! I do notice a slight smell similar to coffee when these get wet..its odd..but I'm guessing it's the filling inside them. I also think this brand of diapers run a little larger compared to other brands. Overall, these are excellent, which they should be for the price. I just wish they were more affordable."

The fit is as expected, similar to Pamper's brand. These diapers work best for daytime, my little one has not had 1 blowout of poop, but has had some leakage of pee in the front overnight. So instead, I use overnight diapers and use these for daytime. I love the quality, they are exceptional but is not great for overnight use in my experience. My baby has not had any irritation using these diapers and it pulls the moisture away from it's skin, keeping my baby dry all day. So happy I would recommend these for sure."

And oddly, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a discount for buying larger quantities as these seem to be the tiniest bit more expensive than the smallest quantity available. So, the 168 count is definitely a convenience purchase, but not a cost saver. Overall, these are great diapers with an odd pricing structure!"

Extremely disappointed because of all the diapers we've ever used these were the best. Unfortunately I'll have to try to find a different brand now"

The material is thinner\nand has the absorbency of Kleenex. The line doesn\u2019t consistently change color, but his clothes are soaked. Half of these lead to wet clothing and Mom.

We would take a break from them for a day or two, do some Pampers or Huggies, have no issues, and when we\u2019d try these again, the same thing happened. At first we thought maybe the fit was off, but now that we\u2019ve tried them over a span of time that fits the recommended weight for the size, we know the diapers are the problem. Such a shame!"

They are soft and not bulky allowing my baby a more natural stance and simple balance while she strengthens her muscles bouncing and standing and doing the walking motion.\n\nWe are in a size 3 at 3 months with an excellent fit. There was a one week of being between size 2 in another brand and 3 with this brand but thankfully it was only a week! My daughter now fits the diaper like a panty.\n\nThe design of the back creates a barrier for breastfed baby poop not to escape. The extract material after the barrier is nice to have in case something escapes. Although that part is not super absorbent trust me it\u2019s saved us a few times. My daughter is a pooper expert sitting up during or immediately after feeding so back runs are common - the barrier really helps.\n\nI don\u2019t like I can\u2019t see when she has peed, but she is changed or checked regularly anyway so it\u2019s not so much of an issue for us.\n\nThe material is soft and the black is stylish but most importantly the comfort and ease of use for our baby is fantastic.\n\nHighly recommend this diaper size 3\n\nThe regular Dryers are not part of this review. I do not like them. We tried those at size 1 - no go for us.\n\nDryper wipes - we like as well (recommended)"

They are super absorbent and we can use them as night diapers and no matter how huge it got it never leaked. It\u2019s better as a night diaper than the night diapers by Huggies, pampers, honest, parents choice. Their texture is also very sturdy and cloth like. If they weren\u2019t so expensive these would be the only diaper we would use. Now that I know how great these are they will haunt me and remind me how crummy the diapers we use now are at every diaper change. :p It\u2019s like getting to drive a brand new luxury SUV for a month and then going back to driving a 2002 dodge caravan. Sure they get the same job done but you know which one you\u2019d pick if the cost weren\u2019t an issue :D The picture is a used diaper after kiddo was playing outside on the farm sliding his butt around on rocks for a few hours. It\u2019s amazing how they hold up! Like how!?"

The quality of the regular dypers in size 4 seemed to not preform as well as the 2 & 3, and were leaving behind strings of bamboo viscose which seemed to irritate him, that I could only remover with bathing or vaseline; and they could no longer get him through the night without leaking. Overall the white dypers still were better than other diapers so when I saw the black dypers I decided to take a chance and see how they matched up.\n\nI was not disappointed. The black diapers are soft, the fit is more snug, design in general is better, no bamboo viscose is left behind causing irritation, and they\u2019re keeping him dry overnight. He\u2019s been having better night sleeps, which means momma has a better night sleep. I\u2019m happy I took the chance and tried these out. If you\u2019re using the other dypers and are thinking of trying these, do it; you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nThey\u2019re also fun, his papa calls him a ninja now that he\u2019s sporting a black dyper diaper."

We have been using these for a couple days now and they are the best fitting diapers we have used so far. They have a wider hip hugging part which secured him more, they look cooler, and they absorb A LOT. No leaks so far even though they run a little big. He is a size 3 in all diapers and the size 3 definitely runs a tad bigger than other diapers and even still no leaks or blow outs.

If you are a parent with a child that suffers from recurrent diaper rash - give theses a try, you won't regret it.\nFit is excellent, no leaks - and I love the stylish black colorway (unique for a diaper).

I sure hope they have charcoal pull ups for when he is ready to toilet train.\nThey HOLD so much liquid.\nSo far no blow outs and when I say they hold a lot of liquid, I mean A Lot! But, the wetness is not on the baby/toddler skin.\nI highly recommend these.\nThe price is not on the cheaper side, but affordable. I actually bought just to try out and I'm glad that I did."

They're really good. Can't say I noticed a ton of difference regarding the smell, but I did get a kick out of how bizarrely cool my son looked wearing them. Like a little 1980s Jean-Claude Van Damme running around the house.\n\nHighly recommend for the amusement alone."

Crafted from plant-based and honest materials, these diapers present a conscientious choice for parents prioritizing sustainability. The incorporation of charcoal enhances their absorbent capabilities, making them ideal for both day and overnight use.\n\nWhat distinguishes these diapers is the use of viscose from bamboo, providing a super soft, high-end, and gentle touch on my baby's sensitive skin. The exceptional absorbency guarantees my baby stays dry and comfortable, reducing the chances of irritation throughout the day and night. The eco-friendly approach, using bamboo-sourced materials, aligns with my commitment to making environmentally conscious choices for my family. These diapers also serve as a natural odor absorber, enhancing the overall diapering experience. Additionally, they absorbed and held well at the edges with no leaks, providing peace of mind and reliability. While the initial investment in these diapers may be slightly higher than conventional options, the super soft feel, high-end quality, natural odor-absorbing properties, and leak-proof performance make them well worth it. The diapers are easy to put on and take off, allowing my baby to move freely and comfortably.\n\nIn conclusion, DYPER Charcoal Enhanced Diapers have become my preferred choice for a reliable, eco-friendly, and baby-friendly diapering solution. If you're seeking diapers that prioritize your baby's comfort, the environment, and offer exceptional performance, these are an excellent investment."

If you are willing to pay a premium for a high quality, soft, highly absorbent, but also eco-friendly diaper, this is a great option. They feel super thick but are also soft to the touch - unlike some other plant-based diapers I have tried in the past. We have had no issues with overnight leaks and have used these almost exclusively for overnights since receiving them. I noticed no odor - chemical or otherwise from these diapers. The black color is unique - not the greatest option if you are dressing your child in light colored pants and do not want it to show through, but otherwise, not a problem. If it is a concern for you - these are manufactured in China, something to be aware of if you prefer to not purchase imported diapers. We tried size 4, and they seem to run a tiny bit bigger than some of the common brand size 4s."

There was one leakout (not blowout) but he's also had some leakouts with the name brand one. There was probably an element of me not putting it on properly since it was the second time I used them.\n\nThe biggest differences is that the straps/velcro thing is a bar that goes across the front middle of the diaper, and that there is no wetness indication that the name brand had. But if your kiddo is only wearing the diaper while sleeping, it's not a huge deal since they just remove the diaper when they get up.\n\nAbsorbancy is fine for overnight, and I didn't run any testing on it. If the kiddo is wearing this during the daytime it might be more tricky in terms of figuring out when to swap it out, so I think the best use case is someone who's only using this when sleeping. All that said, I'm sure it'll work for normal 100% duty as well, but just with a few disadvantages mentioned earlier.\n\nOverall, works well for us. Not having a wetness gauge is certainly a disadvantage, but a 0.5 star deduction still gives this a solid 5 stars for us. Happy with this and would certainly consider using this over the bigger brand if it requires less resources. 4.5 rounded to 5 stars"

I couldn't feel the water and I even used a paper towel and pushed it against where I'd poured the water and the paper towel remained dry.. I did the test two more times and the Dyper never leaked but I could feel the wet inside. I let it sit a while and the water never came out even when I twisted it a bit.\nThe elastic feels soft but it should hold everything in without binding. The diapers are very soft. I love the side closer, like Velcro but softer and you can readjust them as many times and you want. The only negative I found was the looks, I just don't care for black on a baby."

Plus these diapers are also really stylish, and are a stealthy looking black. The fabric and material they use is top notch and the added feature of charcoal as an odor controlling element is a nice touch. Just be aware that the charcoal odor control works better for the liquid filled diapers than the stinky solids. The fit is about what you would expect in sizes compared to other brands, and the elastic bands on the legs and waist are nice and soft and should help to reduce any chafing or rubbing. I give them 5 stars and I can't complain about them other than the fact they are pricier than most of the other ones so if you can live with that, then this is the brand for you."

She\u2019s 32+ lbs and the 6s fit her great, except I do feel like the tabs are a little short compared to other brands. I can fasten the diaper fine but if you had a super round baby you may be totally at the limits of the fasteners.\n\nOccasionally I do notice a little black along where the edge of the diaper lies, though the majority of the inner is white.

There is support around the legs, and elastic the whole way across the back so it moves with your baby, fits well, and helps prevent leaks. The diaper is thin. The fabric isn\u2019t overly soft, but it doesn\u2019t feel like plastic either. For testing/review purposes, I poured 16oz of water into the diaper in the last picture. The diaper expanded and was able to hold the amount without leaking. However, I did remove 1 star because the water pooled up in the legs and was slow to absorb. After all the water was absorbed, the diaper was still wet to the touch, so if you\u2019re using this overnight, the moisture would be up against your little one\u2019s skin. Since the price is almost double that of any other size 2 diaper, I\u2019d like to think it could stay dry to the touch and quickly absorb without pooling first.\n\nEdit - The above test and review was written while I was pregnant. Now that my son is here, I\u2019ve updated my review from 4 to 5 stars. I\u2019ve been using these diapers at night due to the cost, and because diapers specially made for nighttime are not available until a size 3. My son wears a size 1 in regular diapers, but I sized up to a size 2 for nights. These diapers have not leaked at all!!! The Pampers Baby Dry I was previously using usually leaked by the early morning. The Charcoal Dypers have not leaked at all! He wears them for about 12 hours without any issues. When I change him in the morning, his bottom is still baby smooth and doesn\u2019t have any redness or imprints on it. I definitely recommend these diapers for nights!"

Plus when my kid is having a tantrum I can laugh to myself about my \"emo baby\" wearing black and complaining that parents just don't get it.\n\nDepending on how much water gets drunk before bedtime we sometimes have a problem with diaper leaks overnight but so far have not had that problem with these. I also love that they don't contain dyes or perfumes or anything since I'm allergic to some of those. There isn't any sort of wetness indicator stripe on these so you kinda have to just know about how long your kids goes between diaper changes so you know when a clean one is needed.\n\nWhile these are significantly more expensive than the daytime diapers I normally get they are similar in price to the overnight diapers I've been using but are a lot more environmentally friendly so it's a pretty good deal overall. I might just end up sticking with those for nighttime moving forward since my kid seems to like then so much. I would recommend them."

My baby looks like like the baby version of one of those Calvin Klein underwear ads with these on!\n\nBut looks aren't really the important part of diapers. The baby normally wears Huggies Little Snugglers Size 1 and we tried Dyper Charcoal Enhanced Size 1. Recently we've been having some blow out issues with those (not size related) so this was a great time to try something new. These Dyper diapers seem to fit her a little better. We've had no blow outs in the Dypers when we were having ~1 every other day in the Huggies.\n\nI was skeptical that \"charcoal enhanced\" diapers were going to do anything about odor, but the baby's poops were definitely less noticeable with these diapers.\n\nThere's no color-changing strip on these to tell you when they're wet, but they seem to puff up a bit as they absorb moisture, so you can generally tell whether the diaper is dry or not without checking.\n\nThe biggest con with these diapers is the price. They're about 50-60% more expensive per diaper than a similarly sized box of Huggies diapers (and spot checking the larger quantities shows similar price differences). I'm not convinced that these are 50-60% better, though that may depend on whether the Dypers continue to avoid blow outs better than our other diapers!"

We are interested in being more environmentally friendly, so these were a great alternative for our daycare that would not allow cloth diapers.\n\nWe really liked these because they don't break him out after being wet. The daycare did have concerns about not being able to tell if he was wet. So, he was either in an extremely full diaper or being changed when he was barely wet. That is one of the few downsides to these diapers. They look cool, but lack some of the typical features like the wetness indicator line. The bonus is they do hold a lot of liquid without leaking.\n\nThey do run a little larger. I felt like the size 2 diapers fit more like a 3 in other brands. I have a tiny baby, but these could work really well if your baby has chunkier legs. The velcro was strong enough to wrap him tight and we didn't have any leaking around the legs.\n\nOverall, these are great!"

I changed one that was filled with moisture and not a drop had even threatened to escape. They fit wonderfully and the tape adheres very well. These do, in the short time I've been using them, seem to be helping keep baby's bottom less red and irritated, which makes for a happy baby and a happy mama.\n\nOverall, these are just great. They look great and function wonderfully. Anything that can help alleviate diaper rash and pains is worth its weight. These are pricey, but you get a lot of diapers for way you pay. I definitely recommend these, especially if your baby might be having issues with diaper rash in his/her regular diapers."

My phone camera would not see the black color and instead made the black appear gray. So, I simply upped the contrast when I moved the photos to my iPad so that you can see their true black color.\nThe velcro works well. I didn\u2019t even realize that it was velcro at first because it is so soft to the touch! As you can see by the photos, the entire bamd where the logo is, is one super soft velcro strip. This makes these diapers incredibly adjustable. You can see in the one photo where I almost completely covered the entire logo while attaching the velcro. And it is easy to unattach, and reattach the velcro as needed.\nI put these diapers up to my nose and I could barely smell anything. Charcoal is a great ingredient for these kinds of things.\nI did some measurements here on a couple of photos so that you can get a better idea if these diapers will fit your baby or a friends\u2019 or family\u2019s baby. We all know that diapers are a Great Baby Shower Present!\nI highly recommend this product! I hope that these photos and information have helped you on your search!"

They do have an expiration date. Mine wasn't until 2026, which will be plenty of time for me to use them. I did not factor in price in my review as I'm not sure how expensive diapers are these days.\n\nThe size 2 does seem true to size and would likely fit a chunky newborn-few months old, but way too big for a preemie."

Just the black diaper, alone, sets this in a fashion category of its own.\n\nBut, there's more to this diaper than a fashion statement. They are well-made with ample stretch-elastic for form-fitting coverage. Along with the odor-fighting charcoal, the diapers are designed with an elastic leak guard. The ingredients list charcoal, corn starch and other plant-based material and are free of latex, alcohol, PVC, perfumes or phthalates.\n\nBut that's not the reason why these diapers come in at twice the price of big-box stores. I researched the company and was extremely impressed with their global website. While these diapers are made in China, they are distributed by an American Company and certified through several global organizations. First, the diapers are Oeko-Tex certified -- tested for 350 toxic chemicals. Also, these diapers are \"Dermatest\" certified -- a global \"seal of approval\" which ensures excellent skin tolerance and safety for the user. For me, those are important certifications that are much appreciated. There's a lot of quality tucked within this diaper. The company's transparency is also appreciated.\n\nAgain, they are expensive -- almost double the cost of other big-box store diapers. But, compared to other \"plant'based\" socially-responsible companies, they are comparably close in price."

And it looks nice which is almost unfortunate considering they'll be covered up a majority of the time. So far zero blowouts which is always a good thing. There isn't a pee indicator but I've never really relied on that anyways since it's immediately evident by how much they've swelled up if they need to be changed.\n\nMaybe it's in line with their premium pricing and branding, but the packaging is a bit excessive and wasteful. The outer cardboard box is thick with a lot of black ink and contains two sleeves of diapers in the thickest plastic wrapping I've ever seen for a diaper. The sleeves are also printed black. Since these are sold as a box, and not a large one at that, it would be better if they minimized the interior packaging a bit to conserve resources."

To start with, they are infused with Charcoal, known for its odor absorbing qualities and are actually black rather than the conventional white color. They are primarily made from plant based materials. Additionally, they are non-toxic and are free from chlorine, latex, alcohol, perfumes, PVC, lotions, TBT, parabens, sulphates, & phthalates. They do not have any imprint, scent and are hypoallergenic so that there is no issue for babies with sensitive skin. In lieu of conventional adhesive strips, these have extra soft Velcro-like closure which are less likely to come accidentally undone.\n\nAs these are size 1, there are two sealed bundles of 30 diapers each for a total of 60.\n\nThese are definitely a high quality diaper.\n\nI will be gifting these to new Parents-To-Be. I do recommend these."

This ought to last a week or two.\n\nI was worried that they\u2019d be black all of the way through but the interior is just like other diapers. The interior texture is good, not as smooth as some but very soft. The tabs are wide and easy to use.\n\nOur boy has had zero blow-outs, but at size 2 he\u2019s not very active yet. I get the impression that these would be effective at the larger sizes - hopefully we have some time before he starts crawling and we find out.\n\nSkin reaction seems normal - when he\u2019s dry he\u2019s fine. Nothing to indicate that the lotions in the diaper are reactive. Good to know.\n\nBeing black sets them apart, and these are fancy. They\u2019re nice diapers, the comments we get about them are positive (I mean, they\u2019re kind of cool), and they can hold their \u201cstuff.\u201d"

It's only when you take the diaper off that you smell anything. At that point the diaper isn't stopping odors from getting out.

My son and daughter-in-law have tried several different brands, and report Dyper is about the best they\u2019ve found. They\u2019re made with plant-based materials so are better for the environment. They are very absorbent and fit well. The other Dyper diapers they\u2019ve used have been the more traditional white, so these black diapers are extra fun. Such a change from the usual white and pastel-printed diapers, these make a bold statement! The addition of charcoal seems to held control odors.\nWonderful product!"

It's only when you take the diaper off that you smell anything. At that point the diaper isn't stopping odors from getting out. Maybe with older children the charcoal will play a bigger factor.\n\nIn the end they are good diapers which work and keep your child from making a mess everywhere."

They work just as well as the name brand diapers and the look is fun and different. It's more expensive than other more popular brands though because of the materials used. The fit is true to size and they aren't overly bulky and they look pretty cool! Underwear looking actually. Because of the material it doesn't have much stretch as other name brands so it fits \"tighter\". Size up if you are in the higher end of the weight recommendation if you want a looser fit.\n\nIt's a plant based material diaper, but it feels just as comfortable and holds overnight just as well as any premium diaper brand. I would recommend these if you're into plant based materials.\n\nI am giving it a 4 (4.5 if I can) star because of tiny little details. These do not detract from the diaper's performance but are things I consider/prefer as a parent. 1. The black bag packaging (2 black bags in a small box, 4 small boxes in a big black box) has perforation on top but it opens to the diaper's waistband side. I prefer pulling diapers on their folded side so I know I am grabbing only 1 out of the bag. If you are like me, open the bag from the bottom. 2. No size markers - I have 2 kids and its hard to differentiate one size from another, especially if its 1 size difference. I've had it where the kids pooled diapers on the floor \"accidentally\" and having size labels on the diaper makes it easier for me to separate them out. Without a size marker, make sure to keep both diapers' location distinct and avoid pooling accidents (where diapers get mixed on floor). 3. No usage marker - most diapers have that yellow line that turns green to help you visualize pee use. These do not have those so you need to do a feel test or just change more often. 4. My daughter tends to get rashes with these more, probably due to material than brand. Again, just need to replace more frequently (adding to cost).\n\nIf you do not care for the issues I raised above and can afford these, add a star."

What we do have are friends and family who have children. And well most of the time they come prepared, there are the occasional instances of being caught with their literal and figurative pants down. So my wife and I like to make sure that we keep a good stock of baby supplies at our house for just such occasions.\n\n*What I liked*:\n\nThe thing that appealed to us about these diapers first and foremost is the environmentally responsible sourcing of materials. We like to make sure that we purchase responsibly and these diapers seem to fit into that category.\n\nThe next thing that I will say is that, according to the family, these diapers do work well. Are they that much better than other less expensive options? I couldn't tell you for sure, but I suspect not.\n\n*What I didn't like*:\n\nThe one glaring, blaring out of a trumpet, downside to these diapers is the fact that they are nearly 5 times the cost per diaper then similar alternatives. If you have a budget that allows you the luxury of paying that premium, then these are a great option. But many people don't.\n\n*The Bottom Line:*\n\nUltimately, I think these diapers are great for people who are looking to purchase responsibly and have a large enough income to accommodate the very high price. And since I don't have any other real complaints about these, I'll only deduct one star for the (lack of) value proposition. My final score will be four stars out of five. We likely won't order these over again though, as the kids in our lives will likely outgrow these before we use them all."

I would not order the Dyper black diapers regularly because they are not as absorbent as Huggies, but they are almost as absorbent as Huggies. A low price in exchange for absorbency with diapers is just not worth the extra headache a bad diaper can cause.\n\nThese diapers are black, like a black paint painted on the outside, which gave me a lot of concern about the black \u2018charcoal\u2019 paint rubbing off on clothes, getting stuck into the baby\u2019s fingers, etc. The black coating however did not rub off!\n\nI think the charcoal thing is a gimmick. When I ordered these I thought they meant that charcoal was incorporated into the diaper lining. A charcoal component doesn\u2019t have to be a dark black paint. I don\u2019t think the charcoal paint is doing anything for helping odor.\n\nThe styling is cute I guess. It\u2019s a little weird though because it looks like an adult man\u2019s trendy boxer briefs you would buy for $72 off tik tok. Since they anre absorbent I don\u2019t care how they look.\n\nIt is a very large box of Dypers. It is so heavy I am glad the mailman brought it upstairs for me. I wouldn\u2019t order any kind of new brand of diaper in this quantity without first knowing I think the absorbency and material is Ok.\n\nOverall this product is good, just not as good as Huggies.

The diapers are very soft and seem to be the most comfortable diapers I\u2019ve used for my babies. The elasticity is great and the diaper easily conforms to the baby without being too tight to cause rubbing. The diapers seem to hold smells quite well, I would say at least superior to other brands but maybe not exceptional. Finally regarding the value of these diapers, they seem to be a bit overpriced, definitely quite a bit more than other brands I\u2019ve used, and I do not really think the features make up for the price.

That's not a big issue but it makes it more difficult to gauge when they're too wet. I usually go by feel, once the gel inside is obviously close to being saturated they get replaced.\nIn terms of comfort they're lagging a bit behind Pampers and even huggies but baby got used to them after a few days. It seemed like they were slightly more restrictive at first (baby was moving less and kept tapping the leg area) because they don't have the stretchiness of their peers.\nThe #3 seems to be wider overall.\nThe look is different, we like it and so is the packaging. They are the most stylish \"Dypers\" we've seen.\nPrice-wise they are a good buy for the #3 at $99 for 200 diapers, pretty much in the same ballpark as the competition."

The best thing about this brand, is that the diapers are free of chlorine, latex, alcohol, perfumes, PVC, parabens, sulphates, and phthalates. I don\u2019t understand why these toxic chemicals are even used in baby diapers, and so many other products we use. I\u2019m glad to see a brand that cares about baby\u2019s health, and our environment. They are responsibly sourced, and healthier for the planet.\nThese diapers are soft, and don\u2019t irritate her skin. They\u2019re also very absorbent, and keep moisture away from her skin. They don\u2019t have a wetness indicator line, but I\u2019ve been able to tell how wet they are by feel. It\u2019s not a big deal, but would be more convenient to have an indicator. The velcro works well, and the soft velcro strip across the whole front of the diaper, makes them very adjustable to baby/toddler\u2019s size. There\u2019s an inner elastic layer, and elastic across the back to prevent leaks and blowouts.\nWhen I opened the diapers along the perforated line, at the top of the bag, the top of the diaper was facing up. It\u2019s so much easier to pull the diapers out by their bottoms, so I will open the second bag from the bottom.\nOverall, these are high quality, well made diapers, that work just as well as the name brands, and they\u2019re so much healthier for babies and toddlers. Highly recommended."

Especially for older kids who maybe \"should\" be in underwear, I think the black is an awesome option. Anyhow, functionally they perform well. The velcro is fantastic to provide a good fit. We haven't had any issues with leaks or blowouts, even with a few days of baby diarrhea. I don't know the point of the charcoal infusion, but they sure do look cool. Only problem is there is no size on them and no way to write a size on them."

First, they are true to size which is important and the black color looks super cute. I was so used to using white diapers that the black made it look more fashionable if that is possible from a diaper. They did not sag. They are also super soft and actually feel high end, almost feels like a material.I believe that is from the plant bamboo which is used for the exterior. I babysit and one of the kids get terrible irritation from some brands of diapers so I immediately thought of him when deciding to try this product. At this point, he is doing great with this brand, no marks. I did see a few back fuzzies that easily wiped off when cleaning with wipes. These are made with plant based ingredients and no perfumes. The charcoal is a natural odor absorber and the diapers absorbed and held well at the edges with no leaks. These are on the high side in price but they are a step above regular diapers in their natural properties and this multipack made it more cost effective for this quality. A solid product and I recommend and I am glad I have the next size for him to grow into."

Also, I've not found a brande yet that completely prevents blowouts those first few months!\nI especially like that these are produced by a certified B corps company.

Additionally, the eco-friendly aspect of using reusable charcoal diapers aligns well with our family's sustainability goals.\n\nHowever, despite these benefits, we encountered an issue with skin irritation. After a few uses, I noticed that my baby's skin became red and irritated in the diaper area. This was concerning, as we have not had this problem with other diaper brands. It seems that the charcoal material, while effective in many ways, may be too harsh for my baby's sensitive skin. We tried different laundering methods and ensured thorough rinsing, but the irritation persisted.\n\nBecause of the skin irritation, we've had to limit the use of these diapers, which is disappointing given their other positive attributes. For parents considering charcoal diapers, I would recommend monitoring for any signs of skin sensitivity and being prepared to switch to an alternative if irritation occurs.\n\nOverall, while the charcoal diapers perform well in terms of absorption and odor control, the potential for skin irritation is a significant drawback. For babies with sensitive skin, these may not be the best option."

When I was sporadically using the Dyper brand, I submitted the positive review below. However, I've had to update my findings. After using the Dyper brand diapers exclusively for 2-3 days, my little one developed a bad diaper rash. It appeared to be a urine scald. I switched back to my previous brand and waited for the rash to clear. Once it was healed, I tried the Dyper brand diapers again. Within about 2 days of returning to using the Dyper brand exclusively, a rash had started again. I really don't believe I will want to purchase these again after my personal experience.\n\nThese black, Goth diapers appeal to the family who wants to show off their rebel baby. Add a fake tattoo on your baby's arm and baby will be styling! These diapers performed comparably to the big name brands for absorbency. They managed to hold in a major blow out while my little one was in the baby bouncer. Usually an incident in the bouncer involves substances shooting out the back like a rocket! However, the gusset contained the fountain! I have used them overnight and had success for nearly 13 hours with minimal leakage. Nothing can absorb the overnight flood perfectly for that many hours! They are a bit wider and thicker than other brands. Overall, I'm pleased with their quality!"

However, this was my first time purchasing and using the charcoal enhanced, and I\u2019m not happy with them. Besides the black aesthetic look which I do love, that\u2019s about all I like about this diaper. The downfall is the straps, there is absolutely no give, no stretch, even when I make it as loose as possible.. (same issue I had with the Millie Moon brand diapers) the straps cause the diaper to dig into my baby\u2019s belly and legs causing discomfort and red lines on her thighs. Which leads to another downfall, the looser the diaper, the more risk of leaks and blowouts. She fits the original white Dypers size 1 perfectly, so I ordered that in charcoal and they\u2019re so much smaller on her. Now I\u2019m stuck with a box of diapers that don\u2019t fit and I can\u2019t return as I\u2019ve already used a few.. very disappointed and won\u2019t be purchasing the charcoal enhanced again. Definitely stick to the original dypers with the stretchy straps, they allow for a custom fit and won\u2019t dig into your little\u2019s belly like the charcoal ones do."

They cannot contain any ingredients on EWG's \u201cUnacceptable\u201d list, which includes ingredients with health, ecotoxicity and/or contamination concerns.

We used to use the Seventh Generation wipes, but dislike that they are partially plastic. That doesn't seem to match with their company philosophy.\n\nThere are some complaints that the sheets aren't folded together so they pull each other out. It is true that they aren't folded together, and yet we haven't had any issues. Sometimes, the first couple sheets can be a little difficult to get out, because the package is tight. But after that, we find that each sheet does pull the next one out quite reliably, just from the friction of their contact."

Especially when water isn't available. Like in the car. Having 240 of them should keep them busy for a while.\n\nThese arrived in four packages of 60 each. Some may get repackaged in smaller quantities using zip-lock bags. But, the 60-packs work just fine as they are.\n\nThe material looks similar to most disposable towel-like material. It is strong and is very difficult to tear and seems to be as thick (or thicker) than a quality paper towel.\n\nThe wipes are 9\" by 7\" while the packages are 7.5\" by 4\" by 2.25\" thick and are resealable.\n\nThe wipes are nice and moist and have a very slight soap-like odor which I did not find objectionable."

I need wipes that I can use that won\u2019t damage my cpap mask or my VR facial interface, as well as use to wipe down my face after working out or sweating, or at the end of the day, if I\u2019m too tired to wash my face before bed.\n\nWhen I saw these, I liked that they were made of 99% water with the 1% being natural plant material. Of course, plants can be harsh also but after using them on my face, I\u2019ve had no reaction or issues. My face feels clean and has no residue. I do see dirt on the wipe, so it\u2019s definitely cleaning well. The smell is very faint and pleasant.\n\nI also like that you get so many, so I can go longer without having to buy more. There\u2019s 60 per packet and 12 packets total. They work very well for me. Highly recommend."

One box should last us about a month or more, so the price point is good for what you get. The baby wipes also didn't tear up when being used, as others we had tested.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nIt states they are plant based, but no way of knowing what if any of that is true.\n\nOverall we are pleased with these wipes. They did not cause any rash, feel good to the hand and don't come apart when being used. You get a good amount in a box that should last weeks to over a month or more. Overall I would recommend these to others!"

They are thick enough that you can wipe down a baby's arms and legs without the edges rolling up on you. Other brands give me an almost burning sensation on my hands, but not these. The wipes don't tear easily, either. I tested moisture longevity by wiping down a series of objects, they didn't dry out as fast as other brands do. However, I don't care for the smell, and when you pull out one wipe, the next wipe is almost completely out of the package as well. So those things need some work. Overall, these are nice wipes."

The travel pack is perfect for stowing in the car, my purse, or various rooms of the house as needed. I love that they don't use plastic and are plant-based.

Here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros\n1- compostability. If you\u2019re looking for something more environmentally friendly, this is the diaper for you. You need to sign up for their service (additional monthly fee) and buy diapers direct from them.\n2- our baby was generally able to sleep through the night in these diapers. If you get blowouts or leaks, size up and see if that fixes the issues.\n\nCons\nThere were two major quality issues that we experienced recently, and along with the customer service response, will be the reason why I never go back to Dyper brands.\n1- we used a recent package of Dyper wipes (ordered August 2024) and halfway through the package, we discovered red masking tape inside the package. When we reached out to Dyper customer support, this was their response\n\u201c Thank you for the email. Oh no! Rest assured that is just a pack that was the last at the end of the line during manufacturing. I will send you a new order of wipes out! :-) \u201c\nI did not want more of their wipes. I wanted to understand how they planned to rectify their quality control issues. The red tape bled to multiple wipes around it which likely contaminated the whole package. See picture attached.\n2- used a Dyper diaper (ordered July 2024). When I went to change our baby today, I discovered small gel pellets all over her genital area. The seams of the diaper separated on both side and the pellets came out. See video attached. Our baby was in the diaper for about 4 hours. I have not reached out to Dyper customer service.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the wipes and diapers on our baby\u2019s most sensitive areas and if you can\u2019t trust the company to deliver quality products and acknowledge and fix quality control issues, then you shouldn\u2019t be buying their products. I will not be returning as a customer. I am cross posting my review for the diapers and wipes. Videos of the quality control issues are uploaded under each product\u2019s respective review."

Fragrance free... maybe? non-scented... no more!!!\nNobody in our household like the new scent, and we will have to look for alternative. I am sure there are other families who will be switching too due to this latest \"improvement\"."

So I've just been using them on my poor little 6 month old for diaper changes. Then I wiped his face with one, HUGE RASH! So my husband and I both took a wipe and wiped our faces. And what do you know? We both broke out in rashes! It felt like a hot stinging sunburn. Chemical burn? I don't know. 5 out of 5 of us broke out in rashes. Don't buy them."

Dyper brand is so soft, and we've never had a night or nap leak in them. That wasn't true of the other brands we tried. Now that we're potty training (also he's a big boy so his size outgrew the diapers. He's got too much junk in the truck and the diapers were too slim) it just made sense to stick with Dyper training pants. I'm very happy with them. They fit great, are still soft, and don't leak at night. I only wish the charcoal ones came in training pants."

When we got these pull ups for night time, true to brand they are slightly bulkier than plastic name brands but much softer, absorb more, more comfortable (4 yr old opinion) and scent free. We were gifted a pack of brand P that a neighbor had outgrown the other day and I noticed that they were much harder to get on when the kids are wet after bath. They would stick to their legs despite me working to get them dry. This meant we got leaks overnight twice in a month because I didn\u2019t get them sealed around the legs. The has not happened w the Dyper brand, much easier to get on."

I really like these! My little one knows to lift his legs up now when I tell him we're putting pants on, and he did the same for me with these. These diapers are soft and plush. This definitely feels better than some of the other cheap, plastic-y type of diapers. These definitely have a good amount of stuffing, and is way better than some of the drugstore brands I purchased - talk about paper thin on those diapers! I'm not trying to compare these with the \"cheap\" brands, just pointing out the obvious physical difference in the material and stuffing. All that said, the softness does not matter all that much though, as long as the overall quality is good - and these are.\n\nAt first I got these 2T-3T thinking I would save them for when my baby is ready for this size. He is still wearing 12M clothes and I believe we're still using size 4 or 5 diapers! I was surprised when I opened these and they look to be about my son's size. When I put these on him I was surprised that this fits. It does have the stretchy band, so it can stretch quite a bit. I can't say if these run big or small but it seems like most people are saying it runs big, so I am very pleasantly surprised my little one can wear these already. Although these are pretty \"clean\", they do have a bit of a smell to it. I recommend to take these out of the packaging and let it air out for a little bit. Once you let it air out it is fine. We usually take out all the diapers from its packaging and dump it inside a box, regardless of brand. I like to mix and match different ones on a daily basis.\n\nI appreciate the indicator line on these, and that is the one thing about diapers that are non negotiable for me. That's a feature I need to have on my diapers as I often rely on that line. There is a the Dyper giraffe logo on the front, which makes it easier for you to tell which is the front and back. The diapers looks very simple, clean, and straightforward.\n\nThese diapers are advertised as plant based and eco friendly but I didn't see any information about how well these disintegrate in the landfill. I don't know if these do or if they just sit in the landfill for decades. I wish they provided more information from an eco conscious perspective, as that would have been something that would make me support this particular brand of diapers and make these diapers stand out from its competitors.\n\nOverall I would say give these DYPER(s) a try. Diapers seem to be a personal thing that works differently for every baby, this might just be your new favorite. The diapers seem pretty \"clean\" and if that type of thing is important to you, definitely check this brand out.\n\nLast thing I'll add is I would like to urge the company to hi-light the eco aspect of these, as that will be one of the things that will help you stand out from major big name brands. As of now, all I know is these are made from bamboo, but I'm not being convinced as to why I should make the switch to this material over some of the other \"clean\", plant based materials."

She is able to take them off and pull them back up by herself with ease - and they are still nice and snug without leaking. I've read about bamboo vicose before, but this is the first time actually getting something made from this. I was skeptical because my initial, unlearned opinion was that bamboo cannot become something soft?! However these are actually more soft and plush than our usual diapers! It is super absorbent and comfy.\nSIZING\nOur LO was wearing size 4T diapers and I was worried these might be too small. However, when I lay them flat on top of each other, these Dypers are actually about 1/2\" wider and 1\" longer than the 4T diapers. So these are great if you usually use 4T, but may be too big if you normally buy 3T."

Also most of the printed training pants are pretty obvious for front versus back. These have a subtle mark so I had to show my daughter which was which as she likes to put them on herself. It took some practice. Size wise, I went by weight versus age and actually went up a size so they wouldn\u2019t be too tight or binding. That worked out fine for us.\n\nI appreciate the fact they are made without the chemicals.

She never gets a rash with them. They are very soft. She can easily pull them up and down on her own. She still has trouble telling the front from the back but that isn't a big deal.

The size is accurate as others have mentioned maybe slightly a tad big compared to honest but not much, yes a bit on the pricey side but you will always pay more for a \u201cclean\u201d product. My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and we\u2019ve had no breakouts. For that I would continue to pay the price."

If you're loyal to their brand, you'll know their stuff usually runs large; this one is no exception. If you care about the perfect fit, get one size smaller, but if oversized diapers don't bother you, then this will be fine. The larger diaper allows it to contain blowouts better and absorb more liquid. These training briefs are perfect on the go and when you start potty training. Best of all, these will leave your baby's butt dry. Like other diapers, there's no front or back indicator for these. At least, they include the blue wet line indicator."

                    "review": "I currently have a 3 year old who isn\u2019t interested in potty training yet. We had a bunch of size 2T and 3T pull ups left over from my first son but those are already too small. He is about 39lbs and wears size 3T and 4T clothing and size 6 in most diapers. I tried the size 6 in this brand for him and they ran too small for him to wear comfortably. I decided to try these as a slightly larger size option. These actually fit him really well and comfortably. Considering these are supposed to be 4T-5T I would say they definitely run on the small side if you compare to other diapers and toddler clothing. The smaller sizes did fit my daughter accurately though. I think my son just has a little more junk in his trunk and around the sides lol.\nThese briefs have almost all the same features of this same brand of diapers that I really love. They are super soft, have the yellow wetness indicator, and when they get liquid in them they stay pretty firm/solid instead of feeling mushy. What\u2019s even better about these is the elastic between the front and back. It\u2019s super soft and stretchy and comfortable for him to wear and feels more secure than just the little strips most diapers have. What really blew me away is the extra elastic/stretchy pieces down around the leg opening too. It really makes for a much more realistic brief type fit and feeling and far superior to the big name brands of pull ups. My son may be a little bummed about no fun characters but he will get over it. I will mention I did notice a slight smell to them when opening though. It\u2019s not a chemical smell per se but its definitely not a fresh/natural smell. It\u2019s very very faint though.\nEven though my son still isn\u2019t quite ready for potty training I may have him start wearing these regularly anyway just because they fit so nicely on him. They are easy to tear down the sides as well in case you do have to clean them up more like a diaper.\nOverall I really like this training pants/briefs and will definitely continue to use this box. If you have the extra money to spend since they are pretty pricey, I would definitely recommend these. Considering usually training pants aren\u2019t worn for near as long, one box might be enough and might just be worth it to have this nice quality."

He's able to pull them up and down by himself. They don't leak. They're actually absorbent enough to use as diapers. The material is soft, and doesn't irritate his skin.\n\nI asked the manufacturer if these were biodegradable. There's no mention of it on the packaging or on Dyper's website, and I received no response to my query. To me, that means that no, they are not biodegradeable. I like that they're made of bamboo and that the manufacturing process has less of an impact on the planet, but hate that they're not biodegradeable. That's the big thing. Diapers take at least 500 years to break down. Five. Hundred. Years. Basically, my child's great great great great grandchildren will be gone before these training pants fully degrade, and that's just a guess. The first disposable diapers are still solidly full of poo in a landfill somewhere, and won't be degraded for another 450 years.\n\nBetter for the planet, but not best for the planet. Though effective, convenient and the best at keeping my carpet / furniture clean, once they're done I'm going to stick with our cloth training pants for a clean consience."

I\u2019d like to see more data from the company about their eco friendliness, because the packaging states their ingredients which contains plastic materials. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re much less plastic than other brands, I\u2019d just like more info about this. They are also eligible for the REDYPER program, where you send used ones back to DYPER for a price to be composted. How much of it gets composted since it has plastic materials?

To me, an avid Luvs user, this is pretty high of a price point for something my 3 year old toddler wears only at night to catch any leaks. I do like knowing that the material is very safe and clean for wearing for over 12 hrs., but I'm not sure if I would regularly buy these. The packaging is really nice and these make me feel really good about buying, but at the end of the day, it's an overnight diaper for my use and I'm just being honest in saying that I will go back to the Luvs brand instead when these are gone."

We have found Dryper brand pull up style and diapers to be absorbent. They are soft, flexible and keep her dry. Most of all, she is able to be independent!\nWhen comparing Dryper brand to similar items, they are spot on as far as price point. I never found that comparing apples to oranges works out very well! So apples to apples, Dryper brand for the win."

The pants style make it easy for me to take on and off the diaper which is very helpful when potty training. There is also an indicator line which makes it clear and visible when the diaper pants are wet and/or soiled. The diaper pants were soft and have enough stretch for a toddler to wear comfortably. It is nice that these are eco-friendly and uses natural products, However, the price per diaper is steeper than other leading brands which could be due to the natural ingredients. So far, these diapers held up well!"

We had a big blowout in the car, and had to take the whole car seat apart to clean the poop out!!!\n- the price (at almost $1 each, these are some of the priciest diapers I've seen)\n- there is no tab to secure the diaper once you've taken it off and rolled it up. The pull ups we were previously using had a sticky tab, which was appreciated."

While we generally loved the diapers and found them to be absorbent enough for most occasions (usually had to use a more absorbent night diaper as he got older unfortunately), these training pants have been a huge disappointment. We only use them for naps and nights, but our son has woken up wet almost every day. They don't even seem to cut it for his 1 hr naps--often the front will have absorbed some liquid while the back will be totally dry (our son is a stomach sleeper). It seems like the absorbent pad does not soak up or redistribute liquid while the stretch material surrounding it does nothing to contain the mess. Luckily we haven't had any poop in these yet but I can't imagine them doing anything to contain the mess. Agree with other reviewers that these seem more like a maxi pad with stretchy diaper material surrounding it. I thought these would perform better being a training pant specifically designed for older children but I guess we should have known better given the high failure rate of Dyper's regular diapers for overnight use as our son got older."

My daughter hates them and is visibly annoyed when she wears these. I\u2019ve never seen a pull up do this. On any other brand, the elastic lining on either side of the main pad always is spaced out enough that it sits on the buttcheeks, NOT wadded up right in the crotch. I don\u2019t know how it would even catch any poop with how bad the lining bunches up on these. Terrible awful bad. Especially for a low tox expensive product. They really need to fix it."

They are soft to the skin and I didn\u2019t have any reaction to the wipes.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f1 star - I don't recommend it at all, poor quality.\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 2 stars - I don't recommend it, it has multiple faults, or a very high price.\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 3 stars - It's passable, It has some faults but the quality is ok for what it is.\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 4 stars - Product quite acceptable, it does what it promises.\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 5 stars - Product that I totally recommend."

Wipes that are made with this much water (most are not) are the very best for avoiding diaper rash.\nThe scent of this is minimal. They are not overly sopping wet which I like. The wipe is very strong unlike even leading brand names! These don\u2019t rip like others do! The size is very good and offers a complete wipe and then you can use less wipes that other competitor brands. For dirty diaper changes I find that I use four wipes when using competitors brands. I used two of these wipes for the same dirty diaper changes!\nI also like how the packaging has a good closure which keeps the wipes fresh and moist!"

They contain several ingredients that protect and moisturize skin, such as aloe and glycerin and a gentle surfactant-- decyl glucoside, which helps wash away grime.

The wipes are good sized and surprisingly, they are black! I\u2019m not sure if the color is a positive or a negative just because it makes it hard to identify anything on the wipes especially if your tracking changes in bowel habits and such. The wipes have a great texture making them ideal for cleaning delicate skin, yet they are plenty soft enough that they wont cause irritation. The charcoal can be identified by smell and not everyone will like that because these are deemed \u201cunscented\u201d and most prefer fragrance free wipes to smell as neutral as possible. These did not cause any irritation or reactions on sensitive skin or private parts when using to clean up. They hold up very well so you don\u2019t have to worry about them shedding or tearing while wiping. They do seem to dry out a little quicker once opened than other wipes, even the normal version of this brand but you can add a small amount of water to keep them moist. The price point for the set is comparable to other hypoallergenic baby wipe sets. Overall this is a cool looking durable and soft baby wipe that does well on sensitive skin but the color makes it a bit hard to identify things if you need to monitor your child\u2019s bowel habits. Would recommend."

I do like that it's made with plant materials, with nothing harsh like added scents. Seem to be slightly thicker then other wipes as well. Only thing I don't like about them is the packaging. It's difficult to pull just 1 wipe out of the package, they seem to want to come out in pairs."

I mean, I guess it makes sense because they have charcoal in them, but still - wiping a baby's bottom with a black wipe is just weird. You can't see any color on it like you can with the white ones, to see if everything has been removed. I have always said \"wipe until it comes away clean\" but you can't do that if you can't see colors. Big chunks are obvious, of course, but it's the residue that's harder to see.\n\nOther than the color, I do like the quality, texture, and of course the products used to make them.

I was adamant that they needed to be as environmentally friendly as possible while still being comfy and doing their job. Several other brands had a rough feel to them. Dyper brand is so soft, and we've never had a night or nap leak in them. That wasn't true of the other brands we tried. Now that we're potty training (also he's a big boy so his size outgrew the diapers. He's got too much junk in the truck and the diapers were too slim) it just made sense to stick with Dyper training pants. I'm very happy with them. They fit great, are still soft, and don't leak at night. I only wish the charcoal ones came in training pants."

We used the P brand w our first for a while and decided we wanted something more environmentally friendly, so we paid for a composting service. When we got these pull ups for night time, true to brand they are slightly bulkier than plastic name brands but much softer, absorb more, more comfortable (4 yr old opinion) and scent free. We were gifted a pack of brand P that a neighbor had outgrown the other day and I noticed that they were much harder to get on when the kids are wet after bath. They would stick to their legs despite me working to get them dry. This meant we got leaks overnight twice in a month because I didn\u2019t get them sealed around the legs. The has not happened w the Dyper brand, much easier to get on."

                    "review": "I like these training pants / briefs style of diapers. We're actually not using these as potty training pants yet and have just been using it as a normal diaper. I really like these! My little one knows to lift his legs up now when I tell him we're putting pants on, and he did the same for me with these. These diapers are soft and plush. This definitely feels better than some of the other cheap, plastic-y type of diapers. These definitely have a good amount of stuffing, and is way better than some of the drugstore brands I purchased - talk about paper thin on those diapers! I'm not trying to compare these with the \"cheap\" brands, just pointing out the obvious physical difference in the material and stuffing. All that said, the softness does not matter all that much though, as long as the overall quality is good - and these are.\n\nAt first I got these 2T-3T thinking I would save them for when my baby is ready for this size. He is still wearing 12M clothes and I believe we're still using size 4 or 5 diapers! I was surprised when I opened these and they look to be about my son's size. When I put these on him I was surprised that this fits. It does have the stretchy band, so it can stretch quite a bit. I can't say if these run big or small but it seems like most people are saying it runs big, so I am very pleasantly surprised my little one can wear these already. Although these are pretty \"clean\", they do have a bit of a smell to it. I recommend to take these out of the packaging and let it air out for a little bit. Once you let it air out it is fine. We usually take out all the diapers from its packaging and dump it inside a box, regardless of brand. I like to mix and match different ones on a daily basis.\n\nI appreciate the indicator line on these, and that is the one thing about diapers that are non negotiable for me. That's a feature I need to have on my diapers as I often rely on that line. There is a the Dyper giraffe logo on the front, which makes it easier for you to tell which is the front and back. The diapers looks very simple, clean, and straightforward.\n\nThese diapers are advertised as plant based and eco friendly but I didn't see any information about how well these disintegrate in the landfill. I don't know if these do or if they just sit in the landfill for decades. I wish they provided more information from an eco conscious perspective, as that would have been something that would make me support this particular brand of diapers and make these diapers stand out from its competitors.\n\nOverall I would say give these DYPER(s) a try. Diapers seem to be a personal thing that works differently for every baby, this might just be your new favorite. The diapers seem pretty \"clean\" and if that type of thing is important to you, definitely check this brand out.\n\nLast thing I'll add is I would like to urge the company to hi-light the eco aspect of these, as that will be one of the things that will help you stand out from major big name brands. As of now, all I know is these are made from bamboo, but I'm not being convinced as to why I should make the switch to this material over some of the other \"clean\", plant based materials."

She is able to take them off and pull them back up by herself with ease - and they are still nice and snug without leaking. I've read about bamboo vicose before, but this is the first time actually getting something made from this. I was skeptical because my initial, unlearned opinion was that bamboo cannot become something soft?! However these are actually more soft and plush than our usual diapers! It is super absorbent and comfy.\nSIZING\nOur LO was wearing size 4T diapers and I was worried these might be too small. However, when I lay them flat on top of each other, these Dypers are actually about 1/2\" wider and 1\" longer than the 4T diapers. So these are great if you usually use 4T, but may be too big if you normally buy 3T."

My daughter does seem to be motivated by the characters or print ones. But a basic plain white like this is gender neutral and crisp looking. They have the wetness indicator on them. Also most of the printed training pants are pretty obvious for front versus back. These have a subtle mark so I had to show my daughter which was which as she likes to put them on herself. It took some practice. Size wise, I went by weight versus age and actually went up a size so they wouldn\u2019t be too tight or binding. That worked out fine for us.\n\nI appreciate the fact they are made without the chemicals.

She never gets a rash with them. They are very soft. She can easily pull them up and down on her own. She still has trouble telling the front from the back but that isn't a big deal.

I have been using cloth diapers with my todler for the past 2 years but after second baby I wanted to use disposable diapers to help with the transition to 2 kids and I am extremely happy with these. I have used their regular diapers and now that we are potty training these pull ups make it so easy for my toddler to pull them down to use the potty and they can even pull them back up, great practice for real underwear. They also are perfect for an on the go toddler that refuses to lay down for a diaper change, you can change them standing up!! These are a little more pricey the other options but their great for the Earth and hold so much liquid so you don't have to chang them as often so I believe they are 100% worth the extra money."

If you're loyal to their brand, you'll know their stuff usually runs large; this one is no exception. If you care about the perfect fit, get one size smaller, but if oversized diapers don't bother you, then this will be fine. The larger diaper allows it to contain blowouts better and absorb more liquid. These training briefs are perfect on the go and when you start potty training. Best of all, these will leave your baby's butt dry. Like other diapers, there's no front or back indicator for these. At least, they include the blue wet line indicator."

BUT our biggest concern was that there were fibers that shed, and we found them around the head of his ____. They were wrapped around and needed to be carefully removed as he complained that his ____ hurt. Thank goodness that we found it when we did because that could have become much worse.

While we generally loved the diapers and found them to be absorbent enough for most occasions (usually had to use a more absorbent night diaper as he got older unfortunately), these training pants have been a huge disappointment. We only use them for naps and nights, but our son has woken up wet almost every day. They don't even seem to cut it for his 1 hr naps--often the front will have absorbed some liquid while the back will be totally dry (our son is a stomach sleeper). It seems like the absorbent pad does not soak up or redistribute liquid while the stretch material surrounding it does nothing to contain the mess. Luckily we haven't had any poop in these yet but I can't imagine them doing anything to contain the mess. Agree with other reviewers that these seem more like a maxi pad with stretchy diaper material surrounding it. I thought these would perform better being a training pant specifically designed for older children but I guess we should have known better given the high failure rate of Dyper's regular diapers for overnight use as our son got older."

My daughter hates them and is visibly annoyed when she wears these. I\u2019ve never seen a pull up do this. On any other brand, the elastic lining on either side of the main pad always is spaced out enough that it sits on the buttcheeks, NOT wadded up right in the crotch.

The product packaging was beat up since it was shipped in a bag instead of a box, but all packs were present and there was no issue with damage to the individual packs from shipping. The set includes 6 travel sized packs, each containing 16 XL wipes. The wipes are notably larger than most others making them ideal for cleaning up bigger messes. These remind me of many other plant and water based wipes that we have tried. These unscented and work well on sensitive skin. The wipes are soft and durable making it easy to clean up you or your child without the wipe falling apart. The price point for the quantity of wipes that you get is on the high end but these are larger than the average wipe and they come in travel sized packs so the value is there for the right person and circumstances. Overall, these are nice wipes that work well for sensitive skin and leave you feeling clean. Would recommend."

I like that they only have 16 in a pouch, not as many get dried out if they aren\u2019t used on a regular basis. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d work just fine for tushies too, I\u2019m just blessed that almost of all my littles are past that stage."

The set includes 6 travel sized packs, each containing 16 XL wipes. The wipes are notably larger than most others making them ideal for cleaning up bigger messes. These remind me of many other plant and water based wipes that we have tried. These unscented and work well on sensitive skin. The wipes are soft and durable making it easy to clean up you or your child without the wipe falling apart. The price point for the quantity of wipes that you get is on the high end but these are larger than the average wipe and they come in travel sized packs so the value is there for the right person and circumstances. Overall, these are nice wipes that work well for sensitive skin and leave you feeling clean. Would recommend."

The size 3 is a very snug fit, but works fantastic. Size 4 seems to fit better with a little room to spare, but then they leak from the thighs.. esp poops which is NO fun. And I make sure to always pull the safe guards out.\n\nI also love how these diapers don\u2019t get wet on the outside like Huggies and I truly feel I need to change her less with these over Huggies because they\u2019re more absorbent, so I go through less!"

Soft to touch, surprisingly absorbent without the weird small platic-y balls that can come out with mainstream diapers. No fragrance. And cherry on top is the packaging with no plastic! No cute little pictures on them though, will have to rely on her outfits for that."

Over night we put a cloth diaper cover over the diaper, because otherwise the outfit would be soaked by morning.\nSo far they've been worth it for us, given the economy I don't know how long we can afford the extra cost though."

They definitely feel better than some of the other cheap, plastic-y type of diapers but I wouldn't say it is the softest diapers I've felt. The inside of the diapers do feel a little softer than the outside. The softness does not matter all that much though, as long as the overall quality is good.\n\nSizing wise these fit about the same as other popular brands. We're currently on size 3 (sometimes 4), and these fit about the same with no issues about it being too tight or loose. The closure works great and seems comfortable on baby.\n\nI appreciate the indicator line on these, and that is the one thing about diapers that are non negotiable for me. That's a feature I need to have on my diapers as I often rely on that line. These diapers have no cute cartoon or graphics on them, which is fine, as that is one less chemical to worry about. The diapers just look very simple, clean, and straightforward.\n\nOur little one doesn't have blowouts too often as we're mostly at home and we change him as frequently as needed. We rarely have to change him in the middle of the night or wake up to him soaked in his crib come morning. That said, we did experience 2-3 wet diaper leaks. One was during the day and two was at night, so I will not be using these for night time use anymore. Overall these work well in the day time though, and it isn't anything to where I'd say to avoid these or for me to never use this brand again. He could have just had too much water/milk that day, more than usual, so until I test this out throughout a longer period of time, I won't fully blame the quality of the diapers.\n\nThese diapers are advertised as plant based and eco friendly but I didn't see any information about how well these disintegrate in the landfill. I don't know if these do or if they just sit in the landfill for decades. I wish they provided more information from an eco conscious perspective, as that would have been something that would make me support this particular brand of diapers and make these diapers stand out from its competitors.\n\nOverall I would say give these DYPER(s) a try. Diapers seem to be a personal thing that works differently for every baby, this might just be your new favorite. The diapers seem pretty \"clean\" and if that type of thing is important to you, definitely check this brand out.\n\nLast thing I'll add is I would like to urge the company to hi-light the eco aspect of these, as that will be one of the things that will help you stand out from major big name brands. As of now, all I know is these are made from bamboo, but I'm not being convinced as to why I should make the switch to this material over some of the other \"clean\", plant based materials."

The diapers are unprinted, unscented, feel soft, and are durable enough to hold in large amounts of your kid's outputs. The diapers fit snugly, wicks moisture away well, and didn't irritate my nephew's skin. They are on par with other well-known brand-name diapers, and the nephew had no issues with leaks or blow-outs. The only real issue that we had with the diapers is that they do run larger than other diapers. This isn't a huge issue given that diaper sizes vary from baby to baby and because we could use the diapers on my nephew at a later time.\n\nThe thing that makes these diapers unique is that they are made with very eco-friendly materials. The diapers are made of bamboo and are packed in bags made with oxo-degradable materials. There is a service called Redyper where you can send back the used diapers via mail, or via local pick up so that the diapers and their contents can be composted. My niece didn't look up to try this service for her kid, but rested a little easier knowing that the diapers would at least compost down. Overall, as far as diapers go, this is an excellent quality diaper that is safe for your baby's skin and ensures your baby will be dry throughout the night."

I think you really have to do your own investigating to find out what you think about it. But in the end, I would rather use a renewable source such as bamboo, which grows quickly, rather than cutting down the Amazon rain forest."

The quality of the materials and design of the diaper fit is better than anything else we have tried. The feel soft and luxurious to the touch, no rough edges or areas. They are easily adjustable to fit your little one and wear great throughout the day (even with a very mobile and wiggly little one).\n\nI have a one year old that is in a size 3 or 4 and we just love them so much that I ordered a box of newborn size to gift to a friend giving birth soon because I just knew her family would fall in love with them too. However, this item shipped a size 3 which we were able to put to use and I just had to order more for the baby gift :) But heads up - it seems as though there may have been a mixup in the shipping warehouse so make sure you order lots and with plenty of backups on hand instead of waiting til the last minute for a restock."

For now, we'll just be happy to be putting less plastic and chemicals in the landfill.\n\nThe diapers seem to be a bit on the larger side but they also seem to be designed to cover a bit higher than some other brands. The extra protection is welcome and it is nice to know we have a little more flexibility about when to go to the next size up. They also seem to work fine with the top of the front folded down in a pinch. The fact that they are slightly larger is actually an advantage since they can stay in a smaller size longer which includes more diapers in the pack for the same price.\n\nMy only small complaint is that the inner packages aren't labeled clearly with the size. It is marked in fine print on the edge but having opened multiple to see what the best sizes were it would be handy if they were more clearly marked.\n\nOverall very happy with the \"DYPER Bamboo Baby Diapers | Natural Honest Ingredients | Cloth Alternative | Day & Overnight | Plant-Based + Eco-Friendly | Hypoallergenic for Sensitive Newborn Skin | Unscented\"."

Using these, we still saw the occasional instances of diaper rash on those rare occasions when the baby's output exceeded the diaper's absorbency (usually due to night outputs that the baby miraculously slept through). I'm not going to complain about getting a fuller night's sleep though.\n\nThese Dypers did a great job at absorbing MOST of those outputs though and the rashes, when they did occur were pretty limited in scope, meaning most of the moisture got wicked away, leaving just one or two spots or strips that needed to be powdered the next day to get rid of the rash.\n\nThese diapers fit snugly but were a little stiffer around the legs, although for 95% of the day that really didn't matter since the kiddo spends most of their time curled up in someone's arms, on someone's chest, etc. so it's not like their mobility was really impaired. Once they get a little bit bigger and more active that stiffness could become a problem though.\n\n***Overall Value***\n\nAll-in-all, these worked as well as the Pampers we also had in rotation, the biggest difference between these and bigger brands just comes down to price per diaper, and these are definitely marked up at a premium that I'm not convinced is really warranted."

The color strip is easy to see and works well.\nThey are designed thoughtfully with lots if stretch to fit around baby\u2019s curves. The tabs are strong but also gentle against baby\u2019s skin.\n\nLike other reviewers stated, these do run a little big. This really hasn\u2019t been a problem. Even when using these with a 8-10lb baby, they fit well. They are able to reach higher than other diapers and this has prevented a lot of blowouts.\n\nThe absorbency is amazing! We\u2019ve tried a lot of other \u201cnatural\u201d diapers and didn\u2019t have the best luck. Overnight leaking was pretty common. These completely changed that. We haven\u2019t had any leaks since using these.\n\nWe alternate between these and cloth diapers when we\u2019re traveling or if baby is in the care of someone else. I love that they\u2019re a step up from other diapers in terms of sustainability and the quality of ingredients. Will definitely be sticking with these!!"

These diapers would have checked all my boxes back then.\n\nCurrently, I use diapers in my gardening, which sounds weird, but hold on and listen for a minute. I generally line the sides of my hanging planters with them, it helps prevent the soil from drying out so quickly while sequestering some moisture but not retaining so much moisture that the plants drown. I did notice that with coconut coir hanging baskets. I would have to water at least twice a day on hot days but now that I started partially lining the basket with diapers. I can water once a day or sometimes every other day.\n\nI did share a few with a friend who has a newborn and she was very happy to get them. Tiniest is about 6 and 1/2 lb and these diapers fit much better than the size ones they had been using.\n\nFive stars"

I have lichen sclerosis (I encourage all ladies to google it and the names of big brands it's linked to). Bamboo is about the only material that feels natural down there, and doesn't cause irritation or inflammation. So I'm naturally drawn to bamboo for baby.\n\nThis is affordable, and the company has a fun sense of humor. There's no characters or fancy images with licensing fees to pay for, or dye to seep into the diaper. There's no chemicals (except the wetness indicator). And they don't leak or rip. Theyre a win win win in every direction.\n\nDo note that these run a little bit big. I don't think they're a full size too big, enough to order down. But they're great at night till baby fully grows into them."

We also like the size, as they are a bit larger, overall, than other newborn sized diapers. They are wider in the crotch, giving more \"catch\" coverage. They are wider, but also have a bit more height, which helps contain blow outs. They fit a normal weight newborn well, but can be used for a little longer than other brands, as they have more room for growth. You always lose the amount of diapers you get as you graduate to the\u00a0next size, which is a bummer. We love these diapers and definitely recommend them!"

Normally, when a diaper brand boasts environmental friendliness and good-for-the-baby-butt qualities, they cost an arm and a leg. These diapers are surprisingly priced similarly to any box of diapers I can find at Wal-Mart. What really impressed me though is that my newborn had 2 should-have-been blowouts that these diapers completely locked in. The diapers themselves don't really smell like much of anything, which is great because I don't like putting scented things on my baby anyways. I don't have anything bad to say about these diapers. They do their job and they do it well, and I don't even have to feel guilty about the effects on the environment. I definitely plan on getting the subscription after we go through these newborn diapers.\n\nEdit: Okay, now I know why everyone has leaky problems. I do too now that we need to go up a size. NB can support up to 10lbs, my baby is 9.5lbs and his diapers are now leaking. Size and weight definitely matter. Yes, these diapers appear bigger than other brands, but do NOT size down or wait for your baby to get bigger until they \"appear\" to git. Follow the weight recommendations as closely as possible to avoid leaking. If your NB is 9-10lbs, then you need a size 1, and so on."

In comparison, Dyper material feels a little rough on the outside. I know they are bamboo but they feel a tad paper like. And I'm so used to our soft bamboo pajamas, so I guess I was expecting something more along those lines instead. But the interior feels fine and not rough on her skin.\n\nBoth Swaddlers and Dyper have held up well absorbance-wise. No leaking for us. I have also noticed that they seem a little drier and absorb well, so it helps with potential diaper rashes as she's been prone to them lately.\n\nThree other brands I've used are:\n- Kirkland - pretty similar minus the softness that Kirkland diapers have. Also, I stopped using these because I sometimes notice a pee smell. Didn't notice that at all with Dyper.\n- Huggies Overnight - these are much thicker in comparison because they are overnight. So a direct comparison is not really fair here.\n- Coterie - these are defintely softer and more absorbent than Dyper brand. You can see and feel the difference in the higher quality. Much more expensive too tho. I wouldn't say that they are the best comparison but Dyper holds up fairly well next to these.\n\nEven though I like them, they are pricier than what I pay for Swaddlers. Since I find them very similar, and I actually prefer the softness of Swaddlers, this is personally a dealbreaker for me. But if that weren't the case, I'd very easily alternate between the two."

It absorbs a lot of fluid, and we did not have any blowouts after going through about 100 diapers. For containing the mess, these are on par with the more common brands for sure.\n\nThe smell of urine does leak out much more than what we've noticed with Huggies and Kirkland brands... and these Bamboo DYPER's are quite a bit more expensive per unit... so it's hard for me to really recommend these over the competition for most babies, but if your child's skin is very sensitive to normal diapers, then definitely give these a try."

They do hold a lot but noticed that although liquid wasn't coming out of the diaper, it wasn't wicking away from the surface for the larger amounts, meaning dampness against the baby skin. So not sure I'd use these overnight. The sides also have no absorbancy or true waterproofing/plastic, so if the baby shifts around or it's not fitted correctly, if there is anything near that vicinity, the side leg band isn't going to stop it, and it will soak right through the side. It's basically just fabric there. The yellow line also took a really long time to start even hinting towards blue, much longer than I'm used to with other brands. They do have a soft silky feel to them which I like, but not sure they are worth the price. I can't see many people using the compost service. It sounds great in theory but I want dirty diapers out of the house asap before I smell the buildup of ammonia or fecal matter. I'm sure these are great for a subset of moms, but this is definitely a pro/con to decide on, not a no-brainer."

I will say my baby was fitting out of them quickly. I got a size 1 and she is about 10 lbs (1 month old), but I probably would size up if purchasing another box. Compared to Pampers Pure, these were a little bit smaller. I am mainly giving these diapers a 3-star due to high in price and size. I got more for my money\u2019s worth with Pampers Pure diapers that have worked just well considering absorbency so I have gone with using those. I did wait until my baby\u2019s rash healed, one box was sufficient enough to help during that time. Now I am using the pure from Pampers line."
