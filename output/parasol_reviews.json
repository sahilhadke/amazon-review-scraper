My son has such sensitive skin and he will not get a rash in these. Hold capacity is great, hardly ever leakage. It does not have a \u201cblow out barrier\u201d so if your baby is prone to those I guess check the diaper more regularly for fill/ Super soft and not a lot of busy graphics which I love. Quality wonderful I get these as often as I can find them!"

Some people say they leak but this has to be user error. My baby is on the longer side and these fit him like a dream. For example he wears size 1 in Parasol but 2 in Hello Bello or Dyper. So they do run a little bigger but it's what we need. They are so soft and no diaper wash with these. They're perfect, definitely try them! Also a better deal than Dyper on Amazon. Great absorbancy and affordable for those who want less chemicals on their babes sensitive parts."

I have had a couple leaks but only from the sides when they aren't on tight enough or I needed to size up. They are a medium size, especially compared to pampers. (Which I find small) The main reason I love them is they are total chlorine free, toxin free blue wetline strip, and so so soft! Oh, I love they come shipped in a package that is super water resistant so if the box becomes wet, don't worry about it!\nThey only have 3 designs for all sizes but they are simple and sweet. I care more about the make up of the diaper than it's appearance."

While we loved the perks that come with ordering from their direct website, finding their store here on Amazon was a life saver when life got chaotic. Which every parent knows happens. The company has pretty quick delivery time, (3 days), and through Amazon I think got the diaper training pants in 2 days. The training pants for toddlers are just as great of quality as the infant diapers. The price and value is unmatched, so I highly recommend."

These feel and smell like they are the real deal when it comes to organic. Love the stretch all over. My one and only criticism would be to ask them to make them a LITTLE, just a little more structured so when the baby poops they actually fold up easier instead of being so soft that they just blob up and can potentially get the poop where you don't want it. Take note from Kudos structure. I love Kudos and this brand (kudos for their structure and the way they go high up the back and this brand for their more softness) but together they would be perfect! Right now Kudos is out of diapers and these a slightly more expensive but I will buy them."

The velcro comes apart and rubs and are also too narrow in the middle causing a baby wedgie. Parasol solves both of those issues, is softer, more absorbant, and far better at stopping leaks. Zero rashes and even after an entire night of heavy peeing, the baby's bitt was dry to touch. Diaper was saturated but more effective at pulling the moisture away from the skin than any that we've tried.\nSuper easy to put on a wiggly toddler, and easy to wrap up and toss with the built in tape on the back. Also, they are so stretchy that my little one can wear 3/4 or 5/6 confortably.\nWorth every penny. Definitely a \"high end diaper\" Which is why I compare it mostly to cotarie.\nIf you have a child with sensitive skin, the most important purchase it the item they will be wearing 24/7, so the diaper quality is critical. Highly recommend."

We are glad we did.\n\nWHAT ARE THESE LIKE?\nFirst of all, they are ADORABLE. The designs are really cute and make for a fun appearance of the baby. The jeans is our favorite. Front and back design is brilliant. They come in a compact package for easy storage while using them.\n\nSOFT?\nThese are the softest disposables we have felt yet, and the other moms who tried them loved them too.\n\nCLOSURE\nThe closure is velcro and it is resealable. It is great for this size which is pretty much newborn to very small and the baby is not moving around a lot. I am not sure how well they would stay shut for larger more active babies.\n\nABSORBENCY?\nThese absorbed very well. They held all of the waste very well without having to be changed constantly due to leaking. Again, this size is very small, so the baby is not exuding large amounts of waste so it worked great.\n\nLEAKING?\nThese diapers did not leak for this really small size. The elastic on the legs and top back is strong so it keeps the diaper from leaking. For larger sizes, I am not sure how this would be. For this size, it was fabulous.\n\nWOULD THESE BE BOUGHT AGAIN?\nThese diapers are great to have. They are a bit more expensive than cheaper brands, but would be great for special use at least. The other moms I asked to try these were very impressed and wanted to buy them again.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nAppealing to three sets of moms, these diapers are cream of the crop. Adorable in appearance, easy to use and wear, and with little leaking, they were a winner. In a larger size the closures might not work as well, but for small babies, it was fine.\n\nMY RATING\nFIVE STARS. These are really nice diapers. It was a pleasure to test them out. Yeah, I probably would buy again in the future. They also make a GREAT gift for a new mom."

                    "review": "Full disclosure when I was offered these Clear + Dry disposable diapers in a size 3 I did not grab them for me but an immediate family member with 2 kids in diapers. I would consider these \"premium\" diapers as at $36 for a package of 64 is considerably more than the nearly same cost national brand I got them recently whose box contained 204. Both diapers tested well in my reviews for wetness- the national brand had an issue with the wetness indicator in my opinion- but know that there are options for everyone and every budget.\n\nThese diapers come beautifully packaged with kids in mind, they encourage you to use the box again, even as an art project with its printed squirrel inside. The company has a wonderful sense of whimsy and humor with this design with the fake jean pockets (and with the jeans it continues on the other side) and cute \"see you at 2:00 AM\" quote on the other. The diaper itself is super light and soft- I admit to having a hard time opening the diaper and keeping it open without having to hold it down, so you may have a hard time changing a particularly squirmy little one. I don't remember having that sort of issues with other diapers, but then again at 2:00 AM we all have issues there. Part of it may be these are considerably less bulky than some other diapers can be (not that they're all that bulky anymore, but these are rather thin). The wetness indicator, when dry is VERY clear and yellow right down the middle of the diaper. I was a bit concerned that my 1 cup water test I usually do with diapers would easily overhwhelm the leak guard walls- they are small and soft, but only the test will tell! The \"velcro\" closures are even less abrasive than the national brand I reviewed before but I believe neither would scratch or irritate a baby- these especially. Easy open/close and/or repositioning several times.\n\nThe wet test was the most impressive I've seen so far of the 3 total I've done for Amazon reviews. I poured as I usually do an entire cup of water into the diaper and watched as the diaper took a mere 11 seconds to absorb it all! Then about 80 seconds TOTAL later the surface of the diaper was dry to the touch. Great diaper!!! The wetness indicator is VERY clear, what was yellow is now blue- time for a change!\n\nAt first I thought I could overwhelm these very nicely presented diapers- but I'm convinced, for those with the budget, these are SUPER nice."

One of the diapers reads\"See You at 2am\" on the backside and the other diaper pattern mimics blue jeans.The colors are gender neutral being white and gray.\n\nThere is a yellow strip wetness indicator which I find to be incredibly helpful in knowing whether or not my child needs a change. These are very absorbent and I've never felt wetness on the outside or seen any get on my child's clothes.\n\nThese diapers are not scented at all which is preferred by my household that has scent sensitivities.\n\nI am pleased that no rashes, itching, or other skin irritations have been caused by these.\n\nThe diapers work well and though they are bit highly priced, they are well worth it.

My grand babies, 6 months and toddler, are both in cloth diapers most all of the time - when a disposable is needed these are perfect, and will be just as perfect for babyies using disposables all the time.\n\nThey're so SOFT! Inside and the exterior as well. The gentle double leg gussets are comfortable against baby's legs yet fit snug enough to keep the diaper well fitting and prevent leaks. Top of the diapers, front and back, are super soft - very gentle against baby's tummy and back.\n\nThe \"gripper\" closure is soft as well! No hook and loop scratchy itchy noisy sticky tape design here - the \"gripper\" is soft to the touch, quiet when readjusted (no loud tear-away sound like many other diapers have), and yet really holds tight. How it manages to be so soft and quiet and yet hold the diaper in place is a clever design.\n\nLeakproof - even for messy diapers. 5 stars for absorbency.\n\nThese run true to size per the chart, maybe even a bit generous. The size 4 L have plenty of room for my 18# grand baby but still fit leak proof, and they fit my 18 month old grand baby just as comfortably, although she could go up a size and have some more room in the diaper.\n\nThe package itself has a unique packaging material - it's not thin plastic like most disposables, but a heavier weight plastic - hard to describe - but substantial. Tear proof when lifting and carrying the bag. Easy tear opening at the top.\n\nThese are just great disposable diapers - highly recommend!"

Wish these had been around 30 years ago when I fought with leaky, plasticky, diaper rash inducing disposables.

They are softer than the two major brands, and seem more comfortable. That comes are a price, in that the diapers are 'lighter' and thinner, with less of a pulp inner layer to absorb.\n\nThe seal around the legs works well, provided you do pull it out a bit into place, and though the velcro closure isn't indestructable, we had no problem with it, and it was wide enough to be comfortable. We never experienced a leak with these, but my confidence level was a bit lower than a huge swaddler type diaper to leave on my daughter for really long periods of time.\n\nFortunately, we tend to not have to do that, and my daughter does seem to prefer these, move around more freely, and yes, looks a little cuter in the blue-jeans style pattern.\n\nI can understand the difference upsetting someone who gets a diaper that weighs have as much and is seemingly flimsy, but we really had no leaks at all. And there is one huge bonus: our Diaper Genie fills with diapers more slowly if the diapers aren't enormous.\n\nThese are ideal if you expect to change your baby a lot, perhaps for appointments or day care. These aren't the ones for road trips or the like. We also don't use these overnight too often. If you manage your expectations, these are really comfortable and light. I like them a lot."

The print is cute & there are animals on the box that encourages kids to color & reuse the box. The baby that uses the diapers is too young for that, but my older children enjoyed coloring the box. I think this is a good, reasonably priced green diaper."

The diapers have a yellow urine line that changes color when the diaper is soiled. I have not yet seen any leaking or blowouts while using these diapers and they are very absorbent. In addition to all of these things, the diapers are made of earth-friendly ingredients that are safe for my daughter. I have not seen any reaction, irritation, or rashes from these diapers."

For a newborn this would be high on my list but once they start having blowouts I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s enough elastic in the back to contain (or at least help contain) that. Also, the brand we usually use has double velcro on the tabs for a more stable fit. These work ok now but once baby is moving more I\u2019m not sure that will be the case."

I just ordered a few weeks ago and can confirm the diapers you get from amazon are the new adorable design with big improvements including the pee indicator line and better waist elastic.\n\nI had been using Parasol since 2017 with my first and was really disappointed when they changed. Recently got an ad and saw they had reverted to super cute patterns and thought I'd give them a chance again. The new design is super soft, they hold well even overnight and have good fit for my second. During the interim I tried pampers and hello bello and I can tell the fit is greatly improved with parasol. The elastic area aroudn the waist actually stretches and the diapers don't sag like hello bello ones.\n\nLove the black and white new prints with the leaves and puppies. I like that they're unisex and minimal but I do wish there were more patterns to pick from."

However, we have been experiencing leaks overnight as our baby can\u2019t sleep thru the night he nurses but don\u2019t necessarily wake to be changed, one diaper lasted up to 13 hours without having to be changed. Yes, we fed him. Yes we burped him but we did not have to change the diaper because he was dry on the outside, this was a test and absolute test to see just how long this diaper would last and just how long his skin would stay dry. I am highly surprised that his skin was dry after 13 hours in this diaper from 10 PM to 1 PM the next day then we put the second diaper on him that came in the pack at 1 PM and change that one at 9 PM. Still dry to the touch his skin dry and I am highly impressed with these diapers. I wish I could afford them. I would love to try them when he has a rash to see if it would help get rid of it YES I recommend and would buy these diapers again and I may in the future but for now we\u2019re sticking to cloth diapers"

The diapers are very cute with the designs on the bum. They are also very soft. I was amazed at just how soft they were. My kids are adults and disposable diapers felt like sandpaper compared to these. They have a wetness indicator which, to me, is a must.\n\nI originally chose these for the little one but they run somewhat big and a bit wide and fit the older one who is about 4 pounds over the weight limit printed on the packaging. They absorb daytime wetness well but there is a little gap that allows some leakage at night when he is sleeping. They use these during the day and rarely have leakage issues. The diapers don't cause irritation and easy to put on and take off. The designs are really adorable and unisex. If the sizing were accurate and they didn't have a bit of a leakage issue at night, these would be the best diapers my nephew and his wife have tried they told me. But they are sticking to other brands at night and using these during the day along with some cheaper brands. These are quite expensive so they can't afford to switch completely.\n\nThese diapers are definitely unique and pretty absorbent. Definitely very, very soft. Well made in most ways. Well worth a try if your baby has sensitive skin or you are looking for a softer, cuter alternative. If your child is on the low end of the size chart, I would go down a size for a more secure fit."

After being out of \u201cBaby game\u201d almost 2 decades, I was shocked how many new choices are out there..!! PARASOL Diapers in itself is a new brand to me-\nI\u2019m happy to report it was a quality and decent brand For approx. $36 per case.\nAs mentioned our baby watching was that of a newborn who\u2019s just moving from newborn sizing.. So, we ordered this in size 2. (Baby still is just a eat/sleep/poop little peanut- no crawling/walking wiggling yet..!! So, can\u2019t comment on how it holds up with activity-) As for newborn phase, these worked fantastically.. I loved the feel- somehow they\u2019ve created a soft as cloth material.. in a disposable diaper.. even crazier, are the grip tabs- we are talking VooDoo magic! It states these are silent tabs and they pretty much are!!! Why would this matter?? If, ever you\u2019ve had to change a sleeping baby\u2026 Then, you know!! Every noise can startle/wake them, and this was crazy quiet!\nAs for containment they did fabulous- we had no blowouts or leaks.. that is rare for any brand!\nCutest part of all- these truly are designer diapers! On the bottom of the diaper is a tag line saying or, designer Jean image\u2026 OMG!! Yes, it\u2019s a novelty- but, why not??? Everyone that saw this was completely smitten with the idea.\nThese could be given at a baby shower and get any parent excited for their new arrival- all while being the hit of the gifting..!! I\u2019ve never seen this- and trust me, in cuteness + quality arena.. these surpassed all expectations. I\u2019d order again without hesitation.."

I would not recommend these for overnight.\n2) The packaging is ridiculous. It comes in a thick tarp-like bag that does not have perforated line on the top like most brands. It took me a solid 5 minutes to figure out how to rip the side seam open....so not good if you're in the middle of a change and realize you're out of diapers at the changing table and have a baby you're trying to quickly rediaper before they pee everywhere.\nAlso, this comes in a bag, in a \"cute\" box from the company, all inside of an amazon box. This is just wasteful. I mean, other companies do that too with big packages (with several sleeves in it, but those sleeves are thin and clear. This was brand tarp sleeve, then brand box).\n\nSide wall protection is just so so.\n\nOverall, these are decent, but for the price and performance, we'll stick with huggies little snugglers and little movers."

The diapers are a plain white with a little \"See You At 2:00 AM \" written on the front of the diaper in black and others that have a black outline drawing of pockets and zipper at the top of the diaper. The diaper is made of non-woven fabric of chlorine-free wood pulp. Polypropylene non-woven fabric, super absorbent polymer and polyethylene film. It is silky soft on both the inside and and outside of the diaper and there is no smell. The ones I am reviewing are a size 3 which is for babies 16-26 or 28 depending where you are reading about the poundage. The waistline as an elastic band which feels a little tight to me but it will definitely keep the diaper in place. The elastic leg cuffs are a little less tight. Parosol states that their diapers will not be made with chlorine, alcohol, dyes, chemical, fragrances, lotion, Parabens, preservatives, or latex. These diapers do seem to keep the wetness away from the baby. My one concern is the tab that holds the diaper in place does not stick to the diaper all the way to the end of the tab and a baby could catch the loose end of the tab and open up the diaper."

I ordered these diapers for her because I prefer a more natural diaper so these seemed right up my alley. I've used wood pulp based diapers with my other grandbaby and had good luck. So it gave me the confidence to order these. When I took the package out of the box I was surprised how compact all the diapers were in their plastic covering. Which is great because it makes them easier to store. The plastic covering makes you feel kinda fancy with the print and the texture. When I opened the diapers I noticed how soft the diapers were. They seemed comfy cozy for a new baby. They don't have a strong chemically odor like some diapers do. It's so nice NOT to smell baby powdered diapers. I can't stand a coverup smell for babies. Once my grandbaby arrives and I have tried the diapers on her, I will come back to update as best as I can! Happy Diapering!"

I have several babies in my life and I keep diapers in the house and these are very well liked except by the mom with the extra chunky baby, she likes them but they are just too tight for the baby in the leg area with the way they are made.

I liked the old prints on the diapers better, as they were fun and colorful. The new print however would probably show through less lighter colored clothing. The waistand is much more snug than the old design, and is even smaller than other size 5 diapers we've been using. They still fit my toddler, but I'd just noticed they were snugger. I'm guessing this is to prevent blowouts in the smaller sizes. I feel like they don't need this as much with the older sizes. Also, there should be more prints for the older sizes since I sure hope that I don't \"see you at 2 am\" which is printed on the back of the diaper. With all of these thoughts....I still am impressed overall with this diaper. They hold up to the job and I don't have any complaints with performance or skin irritation, etc. I do like the greener thumbprint and where the company is trying to help the environment."

Even wet they didnt leave a wet feeling against skin. And there is NO scent added, thank you! Diapers dont need scents, its terrible for baby skin (and ours too!)

What\u2019s more, these diapers have no chlorine, parabens, fragrances, chemicals, latex, etc. which really pushes them above the competition in eco-friendliness. Many reviews knocked points for flimsy sides and the leakage. So much of that depends on the size and use of the baby, so in our case, it\u2019s been worth trying in the specific case of aiding a diaper rash. Still, considering those quirks, we definitely recommend trying them in the special case of a diaper rash, which is what these are tailor-made for."

They come with two designs, one that says, \" See you at 2 am.\" And the other has a design to look like little Jean's I'm the front and back. They inside is super soft and has what they call a rash shield layer that help's wixknthe moisture off of baby's skin and reduce the risk of rashes. Which we haven't seen a rash yet! They're also more earth friendly, staying away from chemicals and fragrances, parabens, etc. The only thing that I think people would find frustrating is that the sizing it a bit awkward, it's not awful but they definitely run big, and kind of wide. Still made of great things though!"

We recently received the new version in size 3 and they just aren\u2019t as good. The new version feels thinner and less soft. The new elastic waist band is not as good. The old version waist band helped prevent blowouts. Since using the new version we are dealing with blowouts again. Once we are done with this box I\u2019ll be switching to Freestyle diapers."

They do fit now however I\u2019ve noticed they are quite a bit wider between the legs than most size 1, however the length from front to back is similar. They seem to be absorbent and we haven\u2019t had any actual leaks yet however when my daughter urinates the butt of her sleepers feel like they are wet, not actual leaking but it\u2019s like you can feel the pee threw the clothing (only after 1 pee, not even a fully saturated diaper)."

When these get saturated, they don\u2019t just stop absorbing like other diapers, and leak out the leg. The whole diaper just starts bleeding through into the clothes! The whole front of the onesie gets damp. I don\u2019t usually let it get that wet but I tried one overnight and it was the pits in the morning. Also if my son drinks a bottle of milk I have to make sure I\u2019ve changed him very recently or the big pee he has will be too much for this diaper to handle. Not good. Not good AT ALL.\n\nThese diapers are just as absorbent as Huggies, Pampers, and Mama Bear. Their fit is a little less trim than the other brands, but I haven\u2019t had any leaks so that is apparently just aesthetic. The pocket print is pretty funny, as is the cheeky See you at 2:00 am message that\u2019s on some of them. My one complaint is that the tabs (or the places that the tabs are connected to) could be longer. My little guy is pretty slender and they don\u2019t reach very far onto his middle. Also there\u2019s no built in stretch to the tabs like some of the other brands have.\nOverall I would buy these diapers if I wasn\u2019t such a price conscious consumer. They are more than twice the price of the Mama Bear diapers I otherwise use!"

The diapers are still soft and great for sensitive skin. However, we noticed that with the new clear and dry design of pants and \"see you at 2AM,\" the quality is not the same. They do not absorb as much liquid and when we change our little one, we noticed that he is now covered in the absorbent crystals or material. These tend to stick to his skin and makes it much harder to clean him and change his diaper. Had to switch back to a different diaper.

Thinner, sheer sides, less elastic on the sides to hold the diaper close to the legs, and definitely not as absorbent. They're not as soft. Leakage is also a problem. The \"velcro\" connectors don't compare to the other name brands.\n\nBecause of them leaking, you use twice as many and have to deal with the inconvenience of wetness everywhere. They're cute, sure... but does that really matter. I'm sorry but I can't recommend this product.\n\nThis is one of the saddest reviews I\u2019ve ever written.\nPARASOL redesigned their diapers and pretty much destroyed the beloved brand.\nThe old diapers were thick and fluffy, very soft to touch, very absorbent (sleep through the night in one diaper), had strong connectors, sat taller preventing leaks. It was the only brand we were willing to use after trying multitude of diapers.\nNew redesigned diapers are thinner, insert feels like tissue paper, the aren\u2019t as absorbent (at least one change at night after leak plus another change when baby wakes up soaked the pjs again), they don\u2019t hold liquids inside as well (spill on the sides), the connectors rip easily while you stretch them to close the diaper.\n\nVERY disappointing \u2018upgrade\u2019 !\n\nVery cute, but the worst fit of any diaper I\u2019ve ever tried! (And I\u2019ve tried 7 of the most known brands)\nI tried size 1 for newborns. My LO is average size and the diaper was simply huge for him at 1 month old. I tried again at month 2 and the fit is awful, awkwardly tight around the leg, yet extremely bulky, and so wide at the waist that it\u2019s impossible to properly close. Had to throw them away because the number of leaks due to poor design were simply unacceptable."

I have also tested many different brands, and different products from each brand from the big names, to generics, to smaller and designer as well as green brands. Even though I have my personal favorites, I would say that generally, all diapers I have used were pretty good (3-5 stars) and any complaints I had were very minor nits and nats. That said, this is the only time I have EVER had to give a 1 star review for any diaper I have used. How sad!!!\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this diaper is the cute packaging. It came in a brown cardboard box with animals printed on it. And it encouraged children to color and reuse the box. My children had fun coloring in the animals before the box went into the recycle bin.\n\nHere are the biggest problems that I struggled with using these diapers. Never have I struggled this much...sigh...\n\n1. The material soaks through. My baby always feels damp through this diaper. Every single morning, her entire outfit needs to be changed from urine soaking through. It doesn't matter if the diaper is only a little wet or completely full\n\n2. It also leaks. It is just not absorbent enough and cannot be used overnight. Also it leaks due to flawed design because it also leaks from the leg openings. Urine...but unfortunately for us, I activated this pack of diapers when my little one had a bout of bronchitis and was on antibiotics which gave her diarrhea. No matter how bad or how much her No. 2 was... it leaked every single time. Not only was I dealing with a sick and cranky child, I was struggling with this diaper. I thought it was user error at first, but no matter how I fitted the diaper on her, how loose or tight I fastened it, I was always greeted with a huge mess. I opened a box of Huggies and everything was immediately better. And so was her sleep because she wasn't wet and cold at night. The manufacturer claims that leaks and blowouts are caused by sizing issues. I don't think so...but if this is true, perhaps I needed to go up a size or two. But then if that was necessary, then I would say these diapers run 1-2 sizes small because my baby is a true size 3 right now and these size 3's just did not work for us.\n\n3. Doesn't wick moisture as well as it claims or as well as other diapers do. Baby bottom is always more damp, cold, clammy when using these diapers than others regardless of how wet/full the diaper is. I went through a lot more diaper cream using this diapers...\n\n4. The tabs are small, flimsy, and short and do not fasten well. In the same size with any other brand the two velcro tabs always comes together at the front and can tough or overlap. On these diapers, the tabs cannot touch. They are actually 2-3 inches apart when fitted on my child (18 months old, 20 percentile in weight, and wears size 3), signalling that there is a lot less materials used in this diaper. The velcro tabs are also very small. You brush your arm against it and it comes loose. If you have a baby who loves to take of his or her own diaper they will be able to do it faster than ever before\n\n5. Waistband area as mentioned above runs smaller than all other brands\n\n6. I care about this the least...but the diapers are not that cute. They are white. One has \"See you at 2 A.M.\" printed on it. Meant to be cute but is actually a slap in the face considering your child will be miserable by 2 AM and you will be up every single night if you use these. The other has a denim jean print. I thought it was cute when I first saw it but it actually don't look very cute once on the baby\n\nI still have some left so I will finish out the pack now that my baby is feeling better and doesn't have diarrhea anymore. I only use during the day time and change very frequently. I would not purchase or recomend to others because just about any other diaper is better and will outperform this one"

The waist ran small and fit like a size 2 would but the leg openings were MASSIVE. Lots of space around the legs and zero growing room around the belly. We couldn\u2019t leave him in this diaper since it had gaps on legs which of course would mean lots of leaks! We will try again in a few weeks but with the waist barely fitting now we aren\u2019t too confident they will fit later on. They are very soft and the side tabs are quiet and stretchy... but that\u2019s only helpful if the diaper actually fits. Pretty disappointed."

I love trying innovative products and supporting small businesses and I wanted to give my daughter the best. The sample pack Parasol sent me was Size 1, so we had to wait a few weeks until she was big enough to try them. When we did try the sample diapers, they were unimaginably soft, thick, and fit perfectly. I immediately ordered a huge box on Amazon.\n\nThe Parasol diapers I bought on Amazon are so terrible that I am wondering if there was an intentional bait and switch on the part of the company. This can\u2019t be an issue of fake diapers because there are no third-party sellers of Parasol yet. I received genuine Parasol diapers. They just really really suck.\n\nThe pattern on these diapers is the same as the sample pack I got from Parasol, but they are thin, ill-fitting, and don\u2019t hold much pee or poo. Because the diapers aren\u2019t very absorbent, they are extra smelly. The wetness indicator doesn\u2019t work reliably. We\u2019ve only been using them for a couple of days, but we have had multiple leaks and a blowout.\n\nThese diapers look and feel like they were constructed by an intoxicated person using cheap tissues and off-brand tape. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll even use up the box I bought. We might just cut our losses.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t choose these diapers for my baby even if they were the cheapest on the market (but of course they are also super expensive). They are the worst."
