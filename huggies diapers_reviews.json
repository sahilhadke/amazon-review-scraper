                    "review": "I'VE BEEN USING THIS PARTICULAR HUGGIES WIPES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.\n\nI used to use a different brand of wipes. But after a couple of years of buying them, the manufacturer went cheap and changed the material to such an inferrior cloth, that the material would fall apart and leave a bunch of loose cotton all over your skin. NOT GOOD. Becuase now you have to actually wash it off. That's when I switched to Huggies, and have been using them for at least five (5) years.\n\nMANY USAGES:\nI take these wipes with me everywhere, because you never know when you'll need them. And particularly in the Summer, when it's hot and muggy out; I use them to clean and cool off my face, arms and legs, etc... And no matter where I am, when I'm away from home, I always run into moms who needs one for her child. These wipes come in handy for cleaning faces and hands after a meal, while on the run or at home.\n\nTEXTURE:\nThese wipes are sturdy and easy to manage with one hand. Their more than just wipes, their like wash cloths. They don't fall apart, their super soft, and have enough moisture in them to clean your parts effectively. The package says their hypoallergenic, and I believe it, because my family have been using this brand for many years, and no one has broken out from them. We love them, especially for the bathroom.\n\nLIKE WASHING WITH WATER:\nAnother good use is using the wipes like your're washing your hands with water. I carry a wad of these wipes with me when on the go, so when I'm away from home and really need to give my hands a wash, I just squeeze the soapy water out the wipe into my hand and rub both hands together, as if to be washing my hands with soap and water. Then I use the wipe to finish the job. Works every time.\n\nEASY TO OPEN FLIP-TOP:\nI like this brand of Huggies for many reasons, and the easy flip top was one of the main reasons I keep coming back. You can actually flip the top open and closed with one hand, which I do frequently. So, that's a feature that comes in handy when I don't have both hands available.\n\nPRICE IS COST EFFECTIVE:\nAs you know, wipes can be very expenseive; $4, $5 or more just for one pack, and not get many wipes either. Many times the local store runs out of the brand you like, and you're stuck paying a lot of money for a small pack and a brand you're not familiar with. This particular item of Huggies, sold on Amazon comes in a bundle of 11 flip-top packs, so you'll have plenty on hand for a long time. AND THE PRICE IS GREAT, TOO; I bought this item in October 2023, and paid less than $19 dollars, including taxes. With 11 packs in the bundle, that makes the average price for one pack less than $2 bucks!\n\nRECOMMEND?: Absolutely! I recommend this item to anyone who wants a wipe thats super soft, hypoallergenic, has lots of soap and water and cleans like a wash cloth. Oh, the size is great too!"

These wipes are incredibly versatile, working perfectly on the face, body, and bum, making them a must-have for every member of the household. My toddler, who has eczema and sensitive skin, has never had any issues with these wipes, which is a huge relief.\n\nOne of the standout features of these wipes is their thickness. They are durable enough to handle messes without worrying about them tearing or separating from the pack. I also appreciate the design of the packaging, as it doesn't give me too much trouble when I\u2019m pulling out a wipe, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience.\n\nAnother great benefit is the value. The bulk pack is a fantastic deal, especially considering how well these wipes perform for such a reasonable price. Whether for cleaning up after meals or for quick on-the-go messes, Huggies Simply Clean Wipes have been a reliable, everyday essential in our home. Highly recommended!"

These wipes are definitely a standout in terms of both quality and price. Here\u2019s my detailed review:\n\nPros:\nExcellent Quality: These wipes are soft, strong, and don\u2019t tear easily, even when wiping tough messes. They\u2019re gentle enough on my baby\u2019s sensitive skin but still provide thorough cleaning.\n\nFragrance-Free: I love that these are unscented. Many wipes have overpowering scents that can irritate my baby\u2019s skin, but these are completely fragrance-free, which makes them ideal for sensitive skin.\n\nLeakproof Packaging: The flip-top packs are fantastic! They seal securely, so I\u2019ve never had any leaks or dried-out wipes. The design is practical and keeps the wipes fresh for a long time.\n\nGreat Value: For the price, you get 704 wipes spread across 11 packs. This is an amazing deal, especially considering the quality of the product. They last a long time, and I feel like I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth.\n\nNo Bad Odor: Some baby wipes can have a weird chemical smell, but these wipes have no bad odor at all. They\u2019re completely neutral, which is important to me as I want something gentle for my baby.\n\nVersatile Use: These wipes are not just for diaper changes! I use them for cleaning up spills, wiping hands, and even for quick clean-ups when we\u2019re on the go. They\u2019re great for the whole family.\n\nCons:\nSlightly Thin: While the wipes are strong, they are a little thinner compared to some other premium brands. This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but I\u2019ve found that I sometimes need to use two wipes for bigger messes.\n\nFlip-Top Can Be Hard to Open One-Handed: The flip-top lid is convenient, but it can be a bit tricky to open with one hand when you\u2019re holding your baby. This is a minor inconvenience but worth noting.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, I am very pleased with these Huggies Simply Clean Wipes. They\u2019re affordable, gentle on the skin, and do the job perfectly. The leakproof packs, lack of fragrance, and strong yet soft texture make them a great choice for anyone with babies or young children. I highly recommend them \u2013 you get a lot for the price and quality!"

Not only can they use it for their hands and face too, but also for their bottoms in public (I can too)! It\u2019s not super wet like other baby wipes, so it does tend to leave some pieces if you wipe your hands and then touch something while they are still wet (my black work pants in this case), but I\u2019d still prefer to wipe my bottom with these than other baby wipes. I also like that it\u2019s not scented, nor does it leave a chemical feel or smell on you like some hand wipes do."

They are a great deal for the case, because I use them for absolutely everything.\nWashing my makeup, add a few drops of oil to break up my mascara and off it comes, no irritation. I keep them in the car, no sticky hands or spills for me. They are great for sprucing up the dashboards while the gas in filling up, they are super strong and last while scrubbing that coffee off your floorboards.\nThey are wonderful for cleaning puppy dog ears and tear stains, no risk of anything other than water. Iam telling you I use them on everything. They work great next to the potty for a quick clean up, if you know what I mean.\nThey are just water, so if they get a bit dry, because you left the cap open? I put fresh water in the pack and they are good to go. Add warm water and you have a sponge bath in a pinch.\nI highly recommend these for all your needs.\nCheers \ud83c\udf77"

They are a great deal for the case, because I use them for absolutely everything.\nWashing my makeup, add a few drops of oil to break up my mascara and off it comes, no irritation. I keep them in the car, no sticky hands or spills for me. They are great for sprucing up the dashboards while the gas in filling up, they are super strong and last while scrubbing that coffee off your floorboards.\nThey are wonderful for cleaning puppy dog ears and tear stains, no risk of anything other than water. Iam telling you I use them on everything. They work great next to the potty for a quick clean up, if you know what I mean.\nThey are just water, so if they get a bit dry, because you left the cap open? I put fresh water in the pack and they are good to go. Add warm water and you have a sponge bath in a pinch.\nI highly recommend these for all your needs.\nCheers \ud83c\udf77"

I\u2019ve tried almost every single wipe out there and none seem to be this good and value for my money. They\u2019re soft but thick enough to hold up to\u2026well\u2026 blow outs. I love that there is not a scent and do not have lotion or other additives. The wipes are nice and thick. I always keep a pack in every room because they\u2019re great for also spills or a quick wipe down. Even my teenager uses these sometimes to wipe his face and hands when we\u2019re out and about.\n\nUpdate: I\u2019m deducting one star because Huggies has changed the thickness of the wipes. They\u2019re a bit softer but don\u2019t feel as effective as they used to be. Huggies- please go back to the original thickness!"

What actually happens it you can't easily get the edge if the first one and then a random number will be stuck at the perforation and come out together and then leave the next one non-grabable edge laying flat. When you actually need to use these wipes, that art of the system is very important to work right, however across multiple crates I have never seen one pouch work right. Super frustrating every time but the wipes themselves are nice cheap and easy on skin."

The pack contains 11 individual packs, totaling 704 wipes, making it a great value for money. The wipes are a lifesaver for quick clean-ups and diaper changes, especially when I'm on the go.\n\nOne of the standout features of these wipes is their fragrance-free formula, ensuring my baby's sensitive skin is not exposed to any unnecessary irritants. The wipes are gentle and soft, providing a comfortable experience for my little one.\n\nAnother positive aspect is their effectiveness in cleaning messes. They do a fantastic job of wiping away dirt and grime, leaving my baby's skin feeling fresh and clean.\n\nThe packaging design is also convenient. The wipes are well-sealed, preventing them from drying out, and the flip-top lid allows for easy one-handed access when dealing with a wriggling baby.\n\nHowever, one minor concern I have noticed on occasion is that the wipes tend to tear while pulling them out of the package. While this doesn't happen all the time, it can be a bit frustrating during those moments when you need a wipe quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, Huggies Simply Clean Fragrance-Free Baby Wipes are an excellent choice for parents seeking gentle and effective wipes for their little ones. The pack offers great value, and the wipes themselves are gentle and efficient. Despite the occasional tearing issue, I still find them to be a reliable option and would recommend them to other parents looking for convenient and fragrance-free baby wipes."

The contoured shape of the diaper fits snugly around the legs and waist, which helps to prevent leaks, even during playtime. The wetness indicator is also a helpful feature that makes it easy to know when it's time for a diaper change.\nOne thing I particularly like about these diapers is how soft and comfortable they feel. The breathable outer layer helps to keep my baby's skin dry and healthy, which is important to me. I also appreciate that they come in a range of sizes, ensuring that I can find the perfect fit for my little one.\nHowever, one downside to these diapers is that they are more expensive than some other options on the market. Additionally, they may not work as well for babies with very sensitive skin, as they do contain some fragrances and other materials that could potentially cause irritation.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Huggies Little Movers diapers to other parents, particularly those with active babies who need a diaper that can keep up with them. While they may be a bit pricier than some other options, I think the quality and reliability of these diapers make them well worth the investment."

The individual sheets were not as moist as Pampers - so it takes more wipes to get the job done\n2. They are super thick, almost washcloth-like, but lack that gentle on-the-skin, silk feel when wiping\n\nThe scent was perfect - nothing to overwhelm my baby, and who could beat the wipes count for that price? But I could not move past the lack of wipes moisture and the absence of the silky, smooth glide when wiping.\n\nThat said, they are not a bad buy at all if none of the above matters to you."

I feel like they\u2019re a waste for light messes, but they are easy to tear in half without coming apart while wiping. They are weirdly sudsy but that helps cut the grime. Great for dirty diapers, makeup removal, and spit baths. I wish they came in the tall refill packs because I prefer those dispensers and I think the plastic cap on these is a waste of plastic. No fragrance\u2014just how I like it. My second favorite wipe ever (next to Huggies other fragrance free wipes in the refill packs). I always have some of these in my house but I\u2019ve got the other Huggies wipes on Subscribe & Save."

Its very thin, very rough, and you will have to dig almost every other tissue, as they are not pulling one after another .\nI decided to save a few bucks, and regreated. (Better spend time and go for Kirkland tissues-price-wise and good quality, or spend an extra $$ for your babie's comfort). Will keep a full box for myself.\n(Lol!

We don't always have running water close by and we like to use moist wipes for our hands, as alternative to toilet paper, and on surfaces. I don't like the wipes that have a heavy fragrance so I was happy to see that these were unscented.\n\nAlthough these are not antibacterial, they seem fine. They are durable and don't rip easy. They are multi use for us. We can keep our hands clean and also use the wipes on surfaces. We even have wiped down our Yorkie's paws with these when she got muddy. I think the price for only 64 is higher than other wipes though and these are no better than those. I will use what I have but buy wipes in larger quantities to save money."

These are a great value but when it comes to quality, you can tell why they are cheaper. These do not compare to the P a m p e r s Ultra Sensitive wipes. I reach for the other when we have #2s but these work fine for #1s. I am finishing off my box but we will not be re-ordering. These had great reviews, so I am starting to wonder if all those people giving rave reviews have even tried other baby wipes. Honestly the P.C sensitive wipes at WalMart work better than these. When your baby has a #2 and poop is everywhere you don\u2019t want your finger ripping through the wipes & having to use half the pack to get the job done due to the lack of moisture."

The last batch is a different type of wipe, it\u2019s hard like a napkin from a fast food restaurant and the top half of the pack is a bit dry. I\u2019m going to buy a smaller pack to see if this was just a bad batch or if this is a permanent switch. If permanent, I will not be buying again. With that being said, the folks complaining about their box missing one pack are wrong. You get 11 packs not 12, each level has 4 packs so obviously the top level will have 3 packs instead of 4."

They are not very soft at all. They are strong and will hold up well, but they are a bit rough for delicate areas. He also freaked out when I tried these on his face. They are fragrance free, and don't smell particularly strong or anything but there is a slight unpleasant scent to them. I'm not sure if it was the scent or the texture/hardness to them that he didn't like on his face. (To be fair, sometimes he just doesn't like me wiping his face and it might have happened regardless of the wipe). I will use the remainder on myself or for other things, but not on my son.

I'm still torn on if the thickness is better than other natural wipes. My gripe with this specific wipe and I bought 3 boxes - there were many packs where when you pull out one wipe, the next one does not come up beyond the surface like what you expect with tissues. Given some packs were fine, I think there may have been some quality control issues. This makes it tremendously annoying when you really want to pull for another wipe but have to use both hands to fish out the next wipe. Because of this annoyance that happened in multiple boxes, I'd wait till after the QA issues to buy more"

But now, after 4+ years, they've changed the wipes. They are thinner and leave bits on my 3rd baby's bum. This happened when they changed the art on the packaging, and have Mickey riding a bubble. I still have some of the older wipes, and there is a definite difference. The picture shows the better wipes in the old packaging on the left, and the worse wipes in the new packaging on the right. (I tried to get a picture of the wipes too, but you can't really see the difference in quality. It's more of a feel thing.)

You have to wipe more to get them clean since it\u2019s dry which causes their butt to get irritated. I used these first with my newborn, and with irritation doctor recommended using a butt paste. I started using a butt paste and I ended up switching wipes. My babies irritated butt healed. I switched back to these wipes and still used the butt paste. It\u2019s only been 2 days and he has an irritated butt again! Sadly I just missed the return window for the unopened box I have by 4 days\u2026 The material is thicker though compared to some competitors in the same price range which makes it nice and durable.\n\nI will not be buying these again.

They felt this was right out of the package. We ordered a whole box and every package was like this, not just a single package.\n\nThey were functional. But we ended up using more each diaper change because being more dry causes the need to use more. So we went through them faster.\n\nSmart selling tactic, I guess. But there are many brands I find work quite a bit better and also use less wipes. The best wipes I've tried are water wipes, and surprisingly the UP & UP brand from target."

I have to take them apart ahead of time because the seam is hard to find, and the WORST is that one wipe does not follow the next like every single other type ive tried. They come out individually. So its --dig around to find the seam, pull it out gently so it doesn't tear apart, dig around in package for the next. Definitely disappointed by such a poor Huggies product."

This was my first time buying online and I was glad to find these at the lowest price for Huggies. Upon using the first wipe, I was disappointed because it was CLEARLY not made from the same material. I had a pack of store-bought Huggies wipes on hand and compared them. These wipes felt like hard, wet paper. The store-bought wipes were much softer, more like fabric. I decided to get over it since I paid for 704 wipes, and didn't want to waste them. I would just make sure to buy it from the store next time. Now, after using the wipes for several days, my baby is breaking out in a diaper rash. This NEVER happens! I know rashes happen, but this is my 4th baby and I've learned to prevent them. The store-bought Huggies wipes NEVER does this. These wipes are not the same and I do not recommend them."

I also use baby wipes whenever I wash my face and for makeup removal. So once the Pampers wipes were finished I started using these Huggies wipes. They are like wet paper towels and I didn't know how rough they were until I started using them on my face. They feel really rough and I would not recommemd them for baby's sensitive bottoms or skin. It is too abrasive especially to use down there since you are CONSTANTLY changing baby's diaper and each time you are having to wipe and clean their delicate skin which is constantly being exposed to wetness and poop. Believe me, your baby's bottom is going to start looking a little red if you continue to use these, they are simply too rough. They rip very easily also. They are like a glorified wet wipe, the kind you sometimes get when you order food, but rougher. They get dry fast as well. As you start wiping with it, the surface of the wipe begins to almost ball up and become more abrasive like you're exfoliating. I would recommend these for keeping in the car to clean a toddler's hands if they are messy, but definitely not for a newborn and definitely not for washing your face and definitely not for wiping your car's dashboard (they will leave lint and fibers galore!) I will be switching to a softer more gentler baby wipe."

These wipes used to be thick, smooth and silky and not irritate skin. The last few cases (the ones made in the US, sadly- they used to be made in Mexico) have been horrifying- literally like sandpaper- actually caused bleeding. They also fall apart and are linty. I understand sustainability but this feels like severe cost cutting. If you use these and your babies are getting fussy during diaper time, make sure that it's not these wipes. I mean, we're all grown ups and they feel awful to us, I can't imagine how rough and painful they are on a baby multiple times a day."

There\u2019s plenty of things on Amazon where if you try it out and the product is substandard and does not meet your expectations you can return it. For some reason, it Does Not apply to these wipes. So I guess I\u2019m stuck with them. I\u2019ll just give them this one star review and move on and never purchase it again.

The newer ones are smaller and way thinner. I have to fold one of these wipes twice to get enough absorbency for my child; I didn't have to do that with the prior ones. I still have packs from my previous purchase, and if you look at the pictures, you can see the noticable difference. The pack with the oval top is bigger and thicker than the new pack with the round top. I don't know what kind of trickery Huggies is pulling, but I have definitely noticed. This will be my last purchase of Huggies wipes, which is sad, because I was very loyal to the brand."

This has resulted in a product that tears easily, and also doesn't separate properly when trying to remove it from the bag.\n\nI was so happy to have found the original product, and I was going to continue buying these for life. Now, I'll have to find something new."

He has eczema and the ones we normally order from Huggies were going to take a week to come in. So we tried these. And they are no good. I don\u2019t understand how these can be considered sensitive I had to use almost a whole pack on one poop, and it wasn\u2019t helping regardless. I don\u2019t want to have to scape off stuff with a wipe, or continuously wipe back and forth and chafe my baby, I need something more helpful and these wipes aren\u2019t it. I do like other huggie wipes tho but these are terrible."

The only thing I like is the packaging. Perfect for the diaper bag. The top closes. Never a dry wipe. If you can get past tearing wipes each time, than it's a good wipe.

It is very difficult to use them in the crease of baby's skin because they are so stiff. Will never buy these again and I always use nothing but Huggies. I am adding this later.

The wipes are super thin and are not smooth at all, leaving residue worse than toilet tissue. I immediately disposed of the entire \"New Look\" package as the wipes were unsanitary.

I don\u2019t even care that they come out attached to each other but the fact that if one of them isn\u2019t popped up out of the container and I go to pull it out and end up ripping little pieces off the wipe instead just speaks to the quality of these wipes. They are thin, tear apart easily, and frankly for one of the top name brands I think they are absolute crap. Will definitely never buy these again."
