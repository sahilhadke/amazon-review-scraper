They have cute designs just like Honest does too and for a much better price! I\u2019m happy I tried these for my baby.\n\nI see people in the reviews complain about them not being as absorbent as they would like but personally, I would never keep my baby in even a wet diaper knowing he\u2019s uncomfortable. I have an 11 week old baby that sleeps through the night and he doesn\u2019t wake up in discomfort not once for diaper change but he also rarely soils the diaper at night.\n\nHope this helps other parents!"

As a 2-time cancer survivor, I try my hardest to keep toxins out of my kids' lives, & I've done tons of research into what chemical contents to avoid, bleaching processes, pulp, etc. I am especially wary of the PFAS (forever chemicals) that are now known to be ubiquitous endocrine disruptors. According to a trusted source, these diapers have tested non-detect for fluorine (ehich would be evidence of PFAS), have a plant-based liner and are free of fragrances and lotions. The only concern is that they do use ECF (elemental chlorine-free) pulp, which may not be entirely free of coloring and can still create disinfection byproducts. So these are not top-rated for non-toxicity but they are infinitely healthier than a lot of alternatives. One reason I am giving them five stars is that they do not offgas any smell when I immediately open the plastic, unlike another brand I was using of supposedly equal quality and safety. They also seem to fit my daughter better. The tabs do sometimes stick together on the unopened diapers, but I haven't accidentally torn any. Overall, if you are looking for a disposable that does not expose your child to the highly suspect chemicals and fragrances used by so many \"trusted\" Big brands, these diapers are a great, affordable way to go. I will be switching to this brand until I find one without ECF that is still affordable and manages to keep in stock."

We haven\u2019t had any issues with diaper rashes or irritation since switching to Hello Bello.\n\n**Eco-Conscious:** I also love that Hello Bello prioritizes being eco-friendly while maintaining affordability. It\u2019s nice knowing these diapers are made with plant-based ingredients without sacrificing quality.\n\n**Value:** The 100-count value pack is such a great deal. It\u2019s convenient not having to buy diapers as often, and I appreciate the quality at this price point.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend **Hello Bello Diapers** for any parent looking for a high-quality, stylish, and reliable diaper option. It\u2019s a win-win for both baby and parent!"

Super cute! I haven't had any problems with leaks (even after long days away from home with my baby when it's hard to get regular diaper changes done). Sometimes other brands I use have scratchy spots on the waistband that irritate my baby's skin, but I haven't noticed problems with these. The tabs for securing the diaper haven't torn or come off which is also nice to not have to deal with in the middle of a frantic, wiggly diaper change battle! I'd say these are definitely some of the better diapers I've used."

Not only do they seem to have a great amount of absorbing space, but I noticed that the front is not wet when he pees a bunch like other brands where sometimes the pee will continue to soak through the front or sides of the diaper. There is no smell, and there is no pee smell after they\u2019ve been used. They did not cause any form of chafing on my active boy. I truly think that these are great diapers and will continue to get them!!"

Hello Bello and the Honest brands are the BEST disposables we've tried. They don't leak, hold a LOT and have never caused a rash. We actually tried a more expensive, supposedly organic brand real cotton brand that caused a rash on the baby. we didn't think it could be them until after 2 dr visits and the only thing left was the diapers.\n\nThe Hello Bello (and Honest) brand is wonderful! Once you try them and your baby does well with them, it's not worth chancing a rash or an allergy to save a few pennies, or to even spend more. When you find something that works, stick with it! That's what we're doing!"

The printed Wild Cats design is fun, and it\u2019s a nice change from the plain white diapers we normally see.\n\nI am keeping a few of these on hand for when my nieces and nephews visit. The rest are going in a gift basket I\u2019m putting together for my sister who had a little girl a couple months ago. It may be a while before she can use these, but babies grow so quickly, and having a good range of diaper sizes available will be very helpful for her.

I also like that they're made in the USA and donate diapers to families in need."

I was not expecting much and decided to only try the diapers for daytime use.\n\nI have to say that I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with the diapers. We\u2019ve had no blowouts or leaks. Poop seems well contained. The fit is great for my baby, and I love the stretch of the fasteners. I no longer notice a scent, and I actually think it\u2019s for the best that it doesn\u2019t have that baby smell like pampers as it seems free of perfumes that could irritate baby.\nI have since tested these for a full night and they held up.\n\nSide note, my baby likes the star design and points at them.\n\nI recommend testing these for your baby if you\u2019re on the hunt for a good diaper.\nI\u2019ll probably still stick with Millie Moon for regular use because the cost is 35 cents a diaper vs the 43 cents for these Hello Bello diapers."

The design includes a doody-catcher feature but I do think the huggies brand it's better in that area.\n\nAs per sizing they seem to run small based on the size chart, so you might want to consider going up a size if your toddler is on the larger end.\n\nIt\u2019s important to notice that these diapers are free from parabens and phthalates as that's something important for some parents and a priority for sensitive skin babies.\n\nWith 84 diapers in the pack, it\u2019s definitely more expensive than high quality name brands like huggies but relatively similar to other organic brands.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with the Hello Bello Diapers as an organic option for everyday use."

They feel soft to the touch and seem to also be soft and comfortable to wear without causing any skin irritations. I still think some of the name brands might be a bit softer but not by significant amounts. The absorbency is good for a thin diaper and holds up to nap times without leaking. The value pack seems to offer a pretty good value, and I love that they are made in the USA and that this company gives back, donating over 7 million diapers and wipes to parents in need.

When comparing with other popular brands, these stand out as the superior for us. The price point is a bit higher than some others, but the overall Hello Bello brand has become our favorite for all baby and children's products."

These have a blue line that is noticeable once the diapers are wet with urine. The diapers are soft and has a great leg fit. These were a bit small for niece who wears a 6 ( my opinion these could be a size 5 fit) the velcro is snug and hold up really well , but once wet I feel that there is no dry wicking to get urine off of child and would need to be changed right after.\nI do like how soft these are against my granddaughters , but as far as saving me money they just fall short. The price point is average for each package of 17 diapers nothing that would make me change current diapers."

Additionally, they aren't the easiest to put on. The velcro tabs are the same color as the diaper so figuring out front to back can't be done with a quick glance. This gives my toddler granddaughter just enough time to allegator roll out of position. I need a different color tab or a design element that says \"BACK\" or something.

I tried Hello Bello diapers for the first time on him yesterday and every single diaper leaked to the point it seemed like they weren't even catching anything, requiring a wardrobe change with every diaper. I tried checking the waistband and the leg holes to make sure there was a seal every time I put a new diaper on him, but it made no difference. I swapped back to Pampers and the blowouts and leakage stopped. I won't be using these again. I'd donate them, but I don't want to subject others to the amount of clean up and laundry we have to do now. Just poor performance and caused more cleanup than necessary."

Keep that against the skin for a bit and bam you got dipper rash and a fussy baby.\nThey also do not have a back pocket for blow outs. The elastic around the legs are not as soft\u2026 I bet Kristin bell don\u2019t even use these diapers on her own baby\u2026 they suk"

I really wasn't expecting much truth be told, doubly so since my three year old who is nearly 40\" and weighs 35lbs is at the upper limit size wise, so I was totally expecting some wet sheets in the night, but lo and behold, none have arrived! It's nearly a miracle because there's only one other swaddlings type diaper that I know of that works this well. I mean, I had some hope when I opened the package and the diapers, while thin, weren't Paw Patrol thin which as you know is always a good sign. Shoot, they aren't even earlier versions of hello thin. Much happier with this premium version that are made as they should be."

But surprisingly, it's not bad. I will probably revert back to using the brand we already use and love, but this one time we have tried hello bello has convinced me to be open to trying it again (in the future once I probably get some discounts in) The patterns/prints on the diapers were really cute and our toddler had no complaint or skin issues in using this new diaper.

They seem to be hypoallergenic, or at least non-irritating.\n\nOur usual go-to brand is Kirkland, which we still use and love. These diapers are easier to get when we need to order online, and we will continue using them as backups.\n\nThe outer material is soft and cloth-like, making the diapers very comfortable. They do a good job sealing and do not leak at all.\n\nThe only downside compared to Kirkland is that these are thinner and don't hold as much liquid. It's not an issue with regular changing, just something to be aware of."

I don't really know how breathable these are, but my daughter hasn't had any issues with them. There are certainly better \"value\" options - but I do think this is a good premium diaper option if you need something a bit better than average."

They\u2019re not too tight, and aren\u2019t too short (no blowouts up the back!!). The checkered print is so adorable, and the material is very soft (much softer than I was expecting). They cover everything that needs covered, and the tabs stay on really well. I\u2019ve used these overnight, and they don\u2019t leak!! They hold so much liquid, and don\u2019t burst open and have gel beads leaking everywhere. The only downside is that these are a little skinny in the bottom middle section, but the good news is that they don\u2019t leave marks. These are a great option for diapers that come in cute and trendy designs"

I actually think this is the prettiest disposable diaper I\u2019ve used. There is not a pee indicator line on these diapers, which would have been nearly impossible to see among the bright checkered design. I really liked having the line when my daughter was a baby, but as a toddler she tells me when she needs to change, so it\u2019s not something I miss or depend on. I also noticed that these diapers don\u2019t have the same elastic back as the other diapers we buy, although they seem to fit snuggly without it. The absorbency has been great so far, so my overall impression is that these are decent diapers that I would consider again if the price were competitive with my normal brand at the time I need more."

Well I thought to myself my 4th baby Day Day he had this same like circle burns about like a dime size which later on increased to a quarter size on his booty checks and he also was wearing Parents Choice Diapers also, but the chemical burn was on up, higher on him in the area or his booty. Then I didn't know what it was back then and I didn't know to change diapers, because I know with a diaper rash to change diapers, but not with his circular burn like open sores. Well I thought a pressure sore/bed sore, so Day Day ended up having his for about 4-5 months. We took him to the Ark. Children's Hospital E.R. the doctor said to use tons of Vaseline after each change. So when I seen this on Baby Ken and I went to Walmart and bought a box of Rascals and Friends Diapers. Which I was undecided on what to buy? Well some more Hello Bello Diapers or Rascal and Friends Diapers? I already had some Hello Bello Diapers on hand which I had from my baby. I bought the Rascals and Friends, but I didn't use them, instead I used the Hello Bello Diapers on Baby Ken, I used diaper rash cream, I used Vaseline mixed with diapers rash cream, and I used prayer far most very important. I'll tell you within a matter of days this circular chemical burn was completely gone and you couldn't even tell he had a circular chemical burn on both cheeks. These Hello Bello Diapers are 100% chemical free, no dyed, no lotions, no chlorine, no parabans. Hello Bello Diapers are super soft inside ad outside,very cute patterns, cheaper than any other natural diapers other than R & F Diapers (note: Rascals and Friends cost about the same, but R & F are thicker padded diapers with quilted inside of the diaper), Hello Bello Diapers donate diapers to families, Hello Bello gives a percentage of to first responders, Hello Bello Diapers doesn't ball up into clumps after he pees in them. Hello Bello Nighttime Diapers are good too and so is their Pull Up Training Pants, Great Natural cheap option which I love a bunches!!!!!! I plan on stocking up on Hello Bello Diapers for our new addition!!!! I can 100% recommend Hello Bello Diapers and Hello Bello Training Pants!!!!!! So give Hello Bello Diapers a try, or if your weavering as to if you should purchase these Hello Bello Diapers or not, then just start off with a small pack. Hello Bello also have cheap and natural baby lotion, baby wash, baby diaper cream, bubble bath soap, vitamins, baby wipes, baby balm, baby sun screen, and more....... Which I'm ready to try these natural baby products soon!!!!"

An example of sizing discrepancies is Size 2 diapers: some packages state the expected weight is 10-16lbs and other Size 2 packages state the expected weight as 12-18lbs. Some diapers of the same sizes have an inch to an inch and a half difference. We experienced multiple blow outs with these diapers while in the newborn size also. I figured this was due to baby being too small for fit. I bought another brand and waited it out and then switched back to Hello Bello due to having purchased 6 boxes through the company. Had many more blow outs, but worked through them. Moved to Size 1\u2019s, diapers worked well though we did have some overnight accidents(baby only sleeps maximum of 4 hours.) When we opened a new design there were discrepancies. I ordered online through them and am very dissatisfied with their product and their customer support. You only have 60 days to exchange the diapers which doesn\u2019t work if you receive them as a gift before baby arrives or if you choose to stock up while pregnant. Pictures show same size diapers with the sizing differences in different packages and designs. Highly dissatisfied!!!"

These diapers have the stretchy sides and stretchy fit around the thighs, so the fit is snugged up to the skin without being too tight or uncountable. The little tabs that secure the diaper are attached well and can be adjusted to fit your baby securely. They can also be undone and redone with no problem. The diapers are absorbent, and seem to work just as well as many name brand diapers that cost a bit more. You get 30 diapers in this order. I\u2019m happy with the fit, look, sizing, and absorbency. I also feel these have a much lower chance of causing irritation, and appreciate the more natural materials."

They are nice quality overall though and seem pretty premium. The design is very true to the site as well and looks just like the pictures.\n\nMy one major complaint is that the little line that indicates if it is wet or not is hard to read. I understand that this is the case for most diapers that have patterns/prints on it, but how have they not figured it out by now? The line on the Pampers is very obvious and easy to look at; the line on this set is kind of obscured to the point where I didn\u2019t even realize it had a wet line for a while.\n\nOther than that, they\u2019re pretty great.

The tabs stick well and the fit/absorbency seems to be as indicated, but I do feel like these maybe don't have quite the holding capacity of some of the other major name brands.\n\nI typically only get this brand to gift as I find them to be impractically priced for every day use. These feel fancier than most the other brands, so new moms light up when they receive them."

You do pay a bit of a premium for the HB diaper to be made without chlorine, parabens, latex, and fragrance. The Hello Bello diaper is just a smidge smaller than Pampers size 2, most noticeable in the \"seat\" of the diaper. This makes sense because the HB diaper is sized for 10-16 pounds whereas Pampers is for 12-18 pounds - naturally designed to be a little bigger than HB.\n\nHello Bello diapers are super absorbent and work very well. The wetness indicator line is very easy to see. The animal print is adorable, although the darker colors do show through some onesies depending on the clothing color but not a big deal. Unlike Pampers, the Hello Bello diapers don't have a \"blowout barrier,\" but they do have double layers around the legs to avoid leakage there. They are still excellent diapers."

I took a gamble based on the weight range - she was wearing size 5-6 of a club store's brand diapers, and 5-6T training pants, mainly because of the way they fit her thighs. These actually fit just fine. I'm able to have it loose enough (but still snug) on her thighs without sacrificing fit on her gut, and they come up high enough over her butt. I'm definitely happy with that. There's a sight smell to the diapers but not enough for me to think they're intentionally scented, and they haven't caused any skin irritation. The pattern is cute, she loves animals, it's a good break from everything seeming to be princess themed for bodily waste disposal."

We got the size 6 even though my toddler wears size 5 with our previous diaper brand, just in case the sizing chart is different and I would rather have it larger than small so I went with the size 6. It fits great, no issues, and he can grow a little more and still fit in these. I would say the size is probably pretty standard, doesn't run small/big.\n\nI thought these diapers were just ok, they are listed as \"premium diapers\" but I don't feel like they are premium. It still has that plastic-y look and feel to it even if it isn't made from those materials. It isn't as plush as the brand I have been using for the past 3+ years. I do appreciate the wetness indicator and that's the bare minimum I expect to see in all diapers, refuse to purchase ones that do not. I don't mind the colorful 'alphabet soup' design, I like my toddler's clothes and things to have fun colors and designs.\n\nI did test them for overnight and sadly it did not pass the test. My toddler came to my bed around 2-3am and as I was moving my feet to a comfortable position I realized my feet was on something wet. I immediately woke up to see my toddler curled up on the foot of my bed asleep, I quickly got him a new diaper (not Hello Bello) and changed him before it leaked everywhere. The brand that we had been using for years rarely leaks (less than a handful of \"accidents\" in the 3+ years) and just overall feels plush, soft, and premium. I'm not going to say which brand but their diapers are the brand I measure new diapers against every single time I'm trying out a new one. That brand definitely has the premium look and feel AND it comes out to be cheaper per diaper than this one.\n\nOverall I think these work great for daytime use when you have more of a chance to change your child every few hours or so but these just do not work for our toddler during bedtime. He's not someone that pees an unusual amount or anything so we're not comparing apples and oranges here - I take those factors into consideration when testing out diapers. I would still give this a chance because they're good for day time and like anything, everyone's experience will be different. You could find that these are your absolute favorite diapers, so I wouldn't let my experience sway you from giving these a chance. Sadly we probably won't be repurchasing only because my toddler only uses diapers at night (potty trained for day time), and since these didn't past my night time test I don't really have a reason to get these if we're not using diapers during the day."

However, since these diapers are a bit larger, we haven\u2019t encountered any issues with the waistband so far. I hope the waistband is fine as she grows.\nWe are in the middle of potty training, so I didn\u2019t get to fully test them initially. However, during the few times she used them, they held up perfectly. One night, she didn\u2019t wake up to go to the restroom, and the diaper was fine, but there was one night with a small leak. This could have been due to her rolling around in her sleep, so it was a minor issue.\nOverall, these are nice diapers. They might not have the exact same absorbency as the name brand, but they come very close."

I don't think I'd replace my top diaper choice with them, especially since they're the same price point but they are easy to use and comfortable for my LO! The quality feels pretty good so far, and we haven't had a leakage problem to note so far! Not bad!\n\nI'd recommend especially IF you don't care for any of the top name brands out there!

I would not trust these as an overnight diaper. The sloth design is very cute! Overall they are a decent diaper but I will stick with Pampers."

My granddaughter has leaked through these diapers more than once now. It's truly disappointing because everything about these diapers sounded amazing! We normally use Huggies, but upon trying to switch to earth friendlier products, we decided to try these. I thought perhaps that the overall fit could be the reason for the leaks, but they seem to fit her fine. I don't see any gaps, and they appear to fit as they should. It may have something to do with the core liner. Perhaps if the absorbency were improved, they would be considered again in the future. In terms of price, I found them to be relatively comparable in value to other branded diapers. The sloth print is fun and can be used for both girls and boys."

This isn't a recurring problem in other diaper brands I've used (usually Luvs or Walmart brand Parent's Choice but I have also used Huggies) I do think they're great at absorbing, not leaking, and are hypoallergenic (all my babies have sensitive skin.) But I don't think it's worth it when 3-4 diapers in a pack rip and are unusable."

I'm sure most of us shopping for diapers want something that feels comfortable, is absorbent, and can prevent those troublesome blowouts from occurring.\nUnfortunately, the Hello Bello diapers do not encompass all these traits.\nLet's start off with the good. They do feel soft and do not irritate my little one. The elastic stays on pretty well too, allowing me to feel secure about it staying on. Additionally, the designs on these are just too adorable.\n\nAnd now for the bad. These do not have a safeguard in place for larger than average... outputs. If you have little ones that will have the occasional blowout, you're gonna have problems with this brand. There's nothing on the side that would prevent such accidents from causing a catastrophic event. And if you're out in public, well.. it might make your life a little harder.\n\nSo while these are cheaper than those other brand name diapers, if you're looking for something that won't cause a stir when you're out and about, you probably want to avoid this one. You might want to have some of the more premium ones on hand for when you're out and about and use these at home when blowouts are not such a big deal."

The diapers work, they have appropriate gathering at the legs, the velcro works well, and the sloths are cute.

I also notice that her skin is visibly wet when i open the diaper to change them. We\u2019ve used some pampers, but mostly huggies up to this point and even in size 2 huggies she never wet through once, i decided to up her size to a 3 when i. bought these bc she was definitely filling up a size 2 huggie and even with sizing up it doesn\u2019t do the job a packed size 2 huggie can do! i wish all diapers had pretty prints, but at the end of the day diapers get covered by clothes anyways &!8 would prefer for those clothes to remain dry so it\u2019s a no for me unfortunately\u2026 im about to spend the extra money to try the honest company against my better judgement, i like to be somewhat frugal when it comes to stuff like this but after two boys i now have a baby girl and we want all the pretty things!"

Then I used the remainder for day time only.\n\nI didn't notice any leaks during the day, but I noticed he smelt like urine multiple times..which I wasn't sure if it was because a leak went unnoticed while at daycare and it may have been on his pants, or due to poor absorbency of the diaper, causing me to smell the urine in the diaper or from his skin down there, or just the diaper doesn't have chemicals to try to hide the smell.. Either way, it was only an issue when using this diaper. Most likely won't purchase again."

He soaked through. Twice. Miserable night. Even during the day one soaking can pull them down between his legs. My guess is they are just way too thin for older babies. Sort of reminds me of the material in the newer super thin maxi pads, to be honest, but babies gush pee, and a good quantity of it, so I\u2019m not sure these super thin diapers that are now everywhere are up to the task."

It\u2019s always a joy to change diapers when the patterns are this playful!\n\nIn terms of quality, Hello Bello has always impressed me. These diapers are super absorbent and soft on my baby's skin. No leaks, even overnight, and I haven\u2019t noticed any irritation or rashes. I also love that they\u2019re made with plant-based materials and free from harsh chemicals. It gives me peace of mind knowing I\u2019m using something safe for my baby.\n\nThe sizing is spot on, and they fit comfortably without being too tight. Plus, the stretchy waistband and leg cuffs keep everything snug without being restrictive. I\u2019m definitely a fan of these diapers, and I highly recommend them to other parents looking for quality, eco-friendly, and cute diapers!"

I try to make more sustainable choices when I can, and it\u2019s nice to see a diaper company leading the charge in that department.\nThat being said, my only gripe with these diapers is that they could be a bit thicker.

He wears a size 6 & is 26 months old, 30 lbs. sometimes I even put a booster pad in them (like Sposie pads) & they protect him from leaks even more.\n\nAbsolutely love these, and I\u2019ll definitely re-order from this seller in the future. Took about a week to get here though. Even though this picture had French writing on the package, these came in a regular Hello Bello box with English writing.\n\nHope this helps! \ud83c\udf19"

These Hello Bello diapers are super duper soft and clean ingredients which was something I was looking for since they would be on his bottom for 10+ hours potentially. Diapers lasted from 7 pm- 5 am with one feeding in between. They were MAXED out by 5 am and leaked but I feel like any diaper would by that point. I recommend these!!!"

In my picture the first box was all the flower diaper but my second box contained the rest of the designs pictured. The pink zebra print is super cute. My daughter was leaking with her cloth diapers since we\u2019re just months away from starting to potty train. The design and feel of these diapers still has that cloth aspect that we love.

The first box I got was gifted and I liked them for sending to daycare and occasionally using for the fun prints at home. The line can be hard to see on them sometimes. I was disappointed though as I ordered the mystery box and was hoping for at least 2 different prints of the 4 packs in the box however they were all the same print of bugs. I get it was just after halloween so no issue there but really all the same prints. I will try another box again later but I hope it's not another disappointment for print variation."

It look like it was stored in a creek somewhere after it was thrown down a hill. Sides weren't taped off, dusty, black soot stuff all over the box, and and wasted space for 4 bricks of diapers. At first was like \"nah\" and was going to send it back. But the diapers themselves were sealed inside with no holes or grime. I'd suggest the company handle packaging better because the product is good but if they don't handle it with care, I won't be buying again. I also read others had the same issue."

Hello Bello doesn't have an option to get the diapers without wipes on their subscriptions so I was excited to get the diapers through Amazon so I could get just the diapers. I subscribed and they shipped and wouldn't you know it, they were shipped via USPS. Totally pointless for me then. Obviously they don't fit into my mailbox and they don't deliver it to my door so I had to pick them up from our post office (which usually has a line of people coming to pick up Amazon packages)\n\nAs for the diapers themselves, their patterns are fun,the brighter ones do often show through the baby clothes though. They aren't too thick nor too thin. They don't contain all blowouts (is there such a thing?) but are better than some other brands are. It does not give my baby a diaper rash and her skin is slightly sensitive. I'm sure there are better diapers somewhere but for the price I was quite happy and would have kept my subscription if they were delivered to my door."

I bought 2 boxes and they were both the same pattern, which was a bit of a bummer, but not horrible considering the pattern is still cute and at the end of the day, I need the diaper to be absorbent and not cute.\n\nThe 3 rating was more for the product. I bought a 25 pack of the same size to test out and everything worked well. No leaks, nothing. I got this surprise pack and there's been more leaking at night. THE WORST. But also, I've noticed that some of the diapers stick to each other. I'm wondering if part of the reason the surprise pack is such a deal is because there are potential manufacturing glitches. Would explain why the normal priced 25 pack seemed fine but these ones have more kinks in them.\n\nOverall, solid deal though. I'm still going to finish using all 200 diapers."

It is a nice alternative to the Huggies we use so we switch back and forth through out the day when I know my baby is done pooping. The diaper holds the pee but there is a blow out most of the if my baby poops in it. BUT the reason for the low rating is this is the SECOND or THIRD time they've sent the wrong size. I don't have time to keep returning them to UPS and I NEED diapers within a few days. I have it on a subscription so I'm prepared for when I run out, but having to return them really throws things off. I have a size 4 on subscription and they sent a size 2. The first time, I just thought it was a fluke but now I'm getting frustrated."

The sizing is off, everything says size one but they fit smaller than industry standard (we\u2019ve tried many different diapers in her first month to find good ones). They\u2019re not absorbent the way they should be - I should be able to pour some water into the diaper and have the diaper actively soaking up the liquid. Not just sit on the surface. My daughter has wet acidic poops. The diapers don\u2019t suck up any of the liquid from the poop so it just sits pooled in her diaper. And almost every poop diaper has been a blowout. I\u2019ve cleaned more poop from her legs and back in the last 3 days than I have in the 4 weeks prior. And the diaper stays pretty well dry the entire time. The leg holes don\u2019t close around her legs all the way even with the inside elastic pulled out but the waist is too small?? She has chafing on her thighs from how bad they fit and we\u2019ve only used them for 3 days. I will never buy this brand again and I\u2019m getting ready to throw away the remaining hundred plus that I still have sitting in her room."

I picked to get a surprise print, since I love them all, and it cost less. I love the prints we got. They\u2019re actually one of our favorites. They came in a Hello Bello Box. But they were absolutely not up to par. So thin, and leaks! This has NEVER happened with the packs we get directly from their site. So. If you love Hello Bello, or just want to try them. Please do me a favor and don\u2019t trust the Amazon sellers. Go straight to the site."

In my picture the first box was all the flower diaper but my second box contained the rest of the designs pictured. The pink zebra print is super cute.

They absorb pee well, so far after 1 year, no significant diaper leaks with a blow out, and the strap/sides make it easy for your baby to move around while keeping the diaper on. Per consumer reports, this diaper is rated very high. These diapers are also more affordable if you subscribe and save or find these on sale. We like them, our baby doesn't have any skin reaction to them, and we recommend and will buy again!"

They have a long absorbent layer, can hold at least half a days worth of wetness, and the tabs don\u2019t deteriorate even with generous application of water soluble lubricants underneath. No slips, drips, easy tab grip and hold. We haven\u2019t had a leak yet. The only negative we can find is in comparison to some previous brands we loved that went out of business, these do get droopy when full and have no wetness line indicator. Though maybe the droop is the unintentional indicator. Overall love these and will be sticking with them until potty trained!"

It look like it was stored in a creek somewhere after it was thrown down a hill. Sides weren't taped off, dusty, black soot stuff all over the box, and and wasted space for 4 bricks of diapers. At first was like \"nah\" and was going to send it back. But the diapers themselves were sealed inside with no holes or grime. I'd suggest the company handle packaging better because the product is good but if they don't handle it with care, I won't be buying again. I also read others had the same issue."

Hello Bello doesn't have an option to get the diapers without wipes on their subscriptions so I was excited to get the diapers through Amazon so I could get just the diapers. I subscribed and they shipped and wouldn't you know it, they were shipped via USPS. Totally pointless for me then. Obviously they don't fit into my mailbox and they don't deliver it to my door so I had to pick them up from our post office (which usually has a line of people coming to pick up Amazon packages)\n\nAs for the diapers themselves, their patterns are fun,the brighter ones do often show through the baby clothes though. They aren't too thick nor too thin. They don't contain all blowouts (is there such a thing?) but are better than some other brands are. It does not give my baby a diaper rash and her skin is slightly sensitive. I'm sure there are better diapers somewhere but for the price I was quite happy and would have kept my subscription if they were delivered to my door."

I bought 2 boxes and they were both the same pattern, which was a bit of a bummer, but not horrible considering the pattern is still cute and at the end of the day, I need the diaper to be absorbent and not cute.\n\nThe 3 rating was more for the product. I bought a 25 pack of the same size to test out and everything worked well. No leaks, nothing. I got this surprise pack and there's been more leaking at night. THE WORST. But also, I've noticed that some of the diapers stick to each other. I'm wondering if part of the reason the surprise pack is such a deal is because there are potential manufacturing glitches. Would explain why the normal priced 25 pack seemed fine but these ones have more kinks in them.\n\nOverall, solid deal though. I'm still going to finish using all 200 diapers."

For months, we were also receiving creepy beetle juice and halloween prints for \"girls\" prints. Having skulls all over a 2 year old's diaper is weird and just not a smart business move."

It is a nice alternative to the Huggies we use so we switch back and forth through out the day when I know my baby is done pooping. The diaper holds the pee but there is a blow out most of the if my baby poops in it. BUT the reason for the low rating is this is the SECOND or THIRD time they've sent the wrong size. I don't have time to keep returning them to UPS and I NEED diapers within a few days. I have it on a subscription so I'm prepared for when I run out, but having to return them really throws things off. I have a size 4 on subscription and they sent a size 2. The first time, I just thought it was a fluke but now I'm getting frustrated."

They\u2019re not absorbent the way they should be - I should be able to pour some water into the diaper and have the diaper actively soaking up the liquid. Not just sit on the surface. My daughter has wet acidic poops. The diapers don\u2019t suck up any of the liquid from the poop so it just sits pooled in her diaper. And almost every poop diaper has been a blowout. I\u2019ve cleaned more poop from her legs and back in the last 3 days than I have in the 4 weeks prior. And the diaper stays pretty well dry the entire time. The leg holes don\u2019t close around her legs all the way even with the inside elastic pulled out but the waist is too small?? She has chafing on her thighs from how bad they fit and we\u2019ve only used them for 3 days.

Terrible diaper rash, which the doctor told me is actually quite common when using these supposed \u201chypoallergenic, clean-green-environment\u201d diaper brands because these diapers don\u2019t wick away moisture as well as the well-known brands. Although I really liked the designs and so badly wanted to start using these cute diapers, unfortunately I had to immediately stop using the diapers and will stay away from this brand in the future."

I picked to get a surprise print, since I love them all, and it cost less. I love the prints we got. They\u2019re actually one of our favorites. They came in a Hello Bello Box. But they were absolutely not up to par. So thin, and leaks! This has NEVER happened with the packs we get directly from their site. So. If you love Hello Bello, or just want to try them.

I love the designs too they are super cute! My 2 complaints are that there is no pee indicator on them. So the half hour or so between the time the diaper goes on and when she goes down for bed I have no real way of knowing if there's pee in there or not. Sometimes I really have to feel (the outside of her diaper) to see if it feels a little heavier than normal or I've even opened the diaper to see if there's pee because there is literally no way of knowing based on the outside. The second irritating factor is that there are only 24 diapers in a pack. Like just make 1 package with 30 diapers! Aside from that the value for your money is amazing! Other brands are so over priced!"

Size 3 in this brand was the smallest I could find and we started using these on her when she was a size 2 in regular diapers and they were a lifesaver at night! They fit her well then and now that she\u2019s in a size 3 regular diaper. She was always waking up with pee down her back. Once you drop the night feeds and they\u2019re sleeping for longer stretches, an overnight diaper is the way to go to avoid wake ups due to leaking diapers. They hold all the pee for a 10-12 hour sleep stretch. These are great and a good price too. Less toxic than regular brands like Pampers and Huggies. I highly suggest!"
